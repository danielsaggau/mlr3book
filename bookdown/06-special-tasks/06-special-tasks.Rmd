# Special Tasks {#special-tasks}

This chapter will examine the following topics: 

##Survival Analysis 

Survival analysis is used to monitor the time until a specific event occurs.
This specific event could be death, transmission of a disease marriage or e.g. divorce. 
Two considerations of important here, namely on the one hand whether the event occurred within the frame of the given data and how much time it took till the event occurred.
There are two reasons why one cannot use a ordinary regression analysis with survival analysis data: 

- survival data contains solely positive values and therefore needs to be transformed to avoid biases
- Ordinary regression analysis cannot deal with censored observations accordingly

Censored observations are observations in which the event of interest has not occurred, yet. 
Survival analysis allows the user to handle censored data with limited time frames that sometimes do not entail the event of interest. 
Note that survival analysis accounts for both censored and uncensored observations while calibrating respective model parameters. 

In summary, this sub-chapter will illustrate how to conduct optimal survival data analysis.

##Spatial Data Analysis 

Spatial data observations entail reference information.
Treating spatial data using non-spatial data methods could lead to over-optimistic treatment.
Therefore, this sub-chapter will illustrate how to handle spatial data accordingly. 

##Ordinal Data Analysis 


##Multilabel Data Analysis 

Multilabel data analysis deals with data sets that contain multivariate data with an ordering on the dimension.
Numerous target labels are attributed to a single observation. 
Mulitlabel data consists of waves over a specific length. 
Firstly, multilabel data allows one to use modified algorithms, to accommodate data specific characteristics. 

This sub-chapter will introduce two approaches namely the problem transformation method and the algorithm adaption method.
