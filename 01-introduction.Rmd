# Introduction {#introduction}

This is a brief introduction to the R package `mlr3`.

First, the following building blocks are introduced:

* [Tasks] to store data and meta information about the learning task.
* [Learners] to train models and generate predictions for (new) data.
* [Experiments] introduce a class to train a `Learner` on a `Task` and
  provides a convenient interface to access all information of a single
  machine learning experiment.

Next, [Resampling] is introduced to fit a single `Learner` on multiple splits of a `Task` and average the performance.
[Benchmarking] goes on step further, bundling multiple resamplings for comparison.
