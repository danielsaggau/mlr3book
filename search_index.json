["introduction-and-overview.html", "2 Introduction and Overview", " 2 Introduction and Overview The mlr3 package and ecosystem provides a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for classification, regression, survival analysis, and other machine learning tasks for the R language. It does not implement any learners itself, but provides a unified interface to many existing learners in R. This unified interface allows to provide functionality to extend and combine existing learners, intelligently select and tune the most appropriate technique for a task, and perform large-scale comparisons that enable meta-learning. Examples of this advanced functionality include hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble construction. Parallelization of many operations is natively supported. Target Audience mlr3 provides a domain-specific language for machine learning in R. We target both practitioners who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms and researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment. The package is a complete rewrite of an earlier version of mlr that leverages many years of experience to provide a state-of-the-art system that is easy to use and extend. It is intended for users who have basic knowledge in machine learning and R and who are interested in complex projects and advanced functionality rather than one-liners for one specific thing. Why a Rewrite? mlr was first released to CRAN in 2013, with the core design and architecture dating back much further. Over time, the addition of many features has led to a considerably more complex design that made it harder to build, maintain, and extend than we had hoped for. With hindsight, we saw that some of the design and architecture changes in mlr made it difficult to support new features, in particular with respect to pipelines. Furthermore, the R ecosystem as well as helpful packages such as data.table have undergone major changes in the meantime. It would have been nearly impossible to integrate all these changes into the original design of mlr. Instead, we decided to start working on a reimplementation in 2018, which resulted in the first release of mlr3 on CRAN in July 2019. The new design and the integration of further and newly developed R packages (R6, future, data.table) makes mlr3 much easier to maintain and use, and more performant compared to mlr. Design Principles We follow the general design principles below in the implementation of the mlr3 package and ecosystem. Backend over frontend. Most packages of the mlr3 ecosystem focus on processing and transforming data, applying machine learning algorithms, and computing results. We do not provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and visualizations of data and results is provided in extra packages. Embrace R6, clean object-oriented design, object state-changes, and reference semantics. Embrace data.table for fast and convenient data frame computations. Unify container and result classes as much as possible and provide result data in data.tables. This considerably simplifies the API and allows easy selection and “split-apply-combine” (aggregation) operations. We combine data.table and R6 to place references to non-atomic and compound objects in tables and make heavy use of list columns. Be light on dependencies. One of the main maintenance burdens for mlr was to keep up with changing learner interfaces and behaviour of the many packages it depended on. We require far fewer packages in mlr3 to make installation and maintenance easier. mlr3 requires the following packages: backports: Ensures backward compatibility with older R releases. Developed by members of the mlr3 team. No additional dependencies. checkmate: Fast argument checks. Developed by members of the mlr3 team. No additional dependencies. mlr3misc Miscellaneous functions used in multiple mlr3 extension packages. Developed by the mlr3 team. No additional dependencies. paradox: Description for parameters and parameter sets. Developed by the mlr3 team. No additional dependencies. R6: Reference class objects. No additional dependencies. data.table: Extension of R’s data.frame. No additional dependencies. digest: Hash digests. No additional dependencies. lgr: Logging. No additional dependencies. Metrics: Performance measures. No additional dependencies. mlbench: Collection of machine learning data sets. No additional dependencies. mlr3 provides additional functionality through extra packages: For parallelization, mlr3 utilizes the future and future.apply packages. To capture output, warnings, and exceptions, evaluate and callr can be used. "],
["basics.html", "3 mlr3 Basics", " 3 mlr3 Basics This chapter will teach you the essential building blocks, R6 classes, and operations of mlr3. This includes creating supervised machine learning tasks like classification and regression, training models and getting prediction on new data, and evaluating and comparing different models through cross-validation and benchmarking. A typical machine learning workflow looks like this: The data, which mlr3 encapsulates in tasks, is split into non-overlapping train and test sets to be able to evaluate models objectively — we are interested in models that generalize to new data rather than just memorizing the training data. The training data is given to a machine learning algorithm, called a learner in mlr3, that uses it to build a model of how the features of the data relate to the target values. This model is then used to produce predictions on the test data, which are compared to the ground truth values to assess the quality of the model. mlr3 offers a number of different measures to quantify this quality; usually a numeric score. This process may be repeated several times, each time resampling different train and test sets from the original data set. Multiple resampling iterations allow to get a better generalization performance estimate for a particular type of model by quantifying its performance on different data. The mlr3 package provides R6 classes for the essential building blocks of this machine learning workflow: A task encapsulates the data along with additional information, such as what the prediction target is. A learners encapsulates one of R’s many machine learning algorithms and allows to train models and make predictions. Most learners have hyperparameters that affect their operation. A measure computes a numeric score based on predicted and ground-truth values and their difference. A resampling specifies a series of train and test sets. In many cases, this simple workflow is not sufficient to deal with real-world data, which may require normalization, imputation of missing values, or feature selection. We will cover more complex workflows that allow to do this and even more later in the book. For now, we restrict ourselves to simple workflows like the one above for the sake of clarity. "],
["quick-r6-intro-for-beginners.html", "3.1 Quick R6 Intro for Beginners", " 3.1 Quick R6 Intro for Beginners R6 is one of R’s more recent dialects for object-oriented programming (OO). It addresses shortcomings of earlier OO implementations in R, such as S3, which we used in mlr. If you are not familiar with OO programming, it might take a bit to find your way around, but if you have done OO in another language, R6 should feel familiar. We focus on the parts of R6 that you need to know to use mlr3 here without going into further detail. Objects are created by calling the constructor of an R6Class() object. For example foo = Foo$new(bar = 1) creates a new object of class Foo, setting the bar argument of the constructor to 1. Classes have mutable state which is encapsulated in their fields. Continuing with the previous example, assuming that the constructor sets the public field bar to 1, we can access its value through the dollar operator: foo$bar or foo$bar = 2. In addition to fields, objects expose methods that may allow to inspect the object’s state or retrieve information and perform an action that may change the internal state of the object. As an example, the $train method of a learner changes the internal state by producing and storing a trained model. Objects can have public and private fields and methods. As a user of mlr3, you can only access the public variables and methods – the private are only relevant if you want to change or extend mlr3. R6 variables are references to the actual object in the environment; they do not hold the object itself. For example foo2 = foo does not create a copy of foo and store it in foo2, but only the reference to the actual object. foo and foo2 refer to the same object, and setting foo$bar = 3 will also change foo2$bar to 3. To copy an object, use the $clone() method; use the deep = TRUE argument for nested objects, for example foo2 = foo$clone(deep = TRUE). For more details on R6, have a look at the R6 vignettes. "],
["tasks.html", "3.2 Tasks", " 3.2 Tasks Tasks are objects for the data and additional meta-data for a machine learning problem. The meta-data is for example the name of the target variable (the prediction) for supervised machine learning problems, or the type of the dataset (e.g. a spatial or survival). This information is used for specific operations that can be performed on a task. 3.2.1 Task Types To create a task from a data.frame() or data.table() object, the task type needs to be specified: Classification Task: The target is a label (stored as character()orfactor()) with only few distinct values. → mlr3::TaskClassif Regression Task: The target is a numeric quantity (stored as integer() or double()). → mlr3::TaskRegr Survival Task: The target is the (right-censored) time to an event. → mlr3survival::TaskSurv in add-on package mlr3survival Ordinal Regression Task: The target is ordinal. → mlr3ordinal::TaskOrdinal in add-on package mlr3ordinal Cluster Task: An unsupervised task type; there is no target and the aim is to identify similar groups within the feature space. → Not yet implemented Spatial Task: Observations in the task have spatio-temporal information (e.g. coordinates). → Not yet implemented in add-on package mlr3spatiotemporal 3.2.2 Task Creation As an example, we will create a regression task using the mtcars data set from the package datasets and predict the target &quot;mpg&quot; (miles per gallon). We only consider the first two features in the dataset for brevity. First, we load and prepare the data. data(&quot;mtcars&quot;, package = &quot;datasets&quot;) data = mtcars[, 1:3] str(data) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 32 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ mpg : num 21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ... ## $ cyl : num 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ... ## $ disp: num 160 160 108 258 360 ... Next, we create the task using the constructor for a regression task object (TaskRegr$new) and give the following information: id: An arbitrary identifier for the task, used in plots and summaries. backend: This parameter allows fine-grained control over how data is accessed. Here, we simply provide the dataset which is automatically converted to a DataBackendDataTable. We could also construct a DataBackend manually. target: The name of the target column for the regression problem. library(mlr3) task_mtcars = TaskRegr$new(id = &quot;cars&quot;, backend = data, target = &quot;mpg&quot;) print(task_mtcars) ## &lt;TaskRegr:cars&gt; (32 x 3) ## * Target: mpg ## * Properties: - ## Features (2): ## * dbl (2): cyl, disp The print() method gives a short summary of the task: it has 32 observations and 3 columns, of which 2 are features. We can also plot the task using the mlr3viz package, which gives a graphical summary of its properties: library(mlr3viz) autoplot(task_mtcars, type = &quot;pairs&quot;) ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;GGally&#39;: ## method from ## +.gg ggplot2 3.2.3 Predefined tasks mlr3 ships with a few predefined machine learning tasks. These are stored in an R6 Dictionary (a key-value store) named mlr3::mlr_tasks. Printing it gives the keys (the names of the datasets): mlr_tasks ## &lt;DictionaryTask&gt; with 9 stored values ## Keys: boston_housing, german_credit, iris, mtcars, pima, sonar, spam, ## wine, zoo We can get a more informative summary of the example tasks by converting the dictionary to a data.table() object: library(data.table) as.data.table(mlr_tasks) ## key task_type nrow ncol lgl int dbl chr fct ord pxc ## 1: boston_housing regr 506 19 0 3 13 0 2 0 0 ## 2: german_credit classif 1000 21 0 0 7 0 12 1 0 ## 3: iris classif 150 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 ## 4: mtcars regr 32 11 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 ## 5: pima classif 768 9 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 ## 6: sonar classif 208 61 0 0 60 0 0 0 0 ## 7: spam classif 4601 58 0 0 57 0 0 0 0 ## 8: wine classif 178 14 0 2 11 0 0 0 0 ## 9: zoo classif 101 17 15 1 0 0 0 0 0 To get a task from the dictionary, we use the $get() method from the mlr_tasks class and assign the return value to a new object. For example, to use the iris data set for classification: task_iris = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) print(task_iris) ## &lt;TaskClassif:iris&gt; (150 x 5) ## * Target: Species ## * Properties: multiclass ## Features (4): ## * dbl (4): Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width 3.2.4 Task API All task properties and characteristics can be queried using the task’s public fields and methods (see Task). Methods are also used to change the behavior of the task. 3.2.4.1 Retrieving Data The data stored in a task can be retrieved directly from fields, for example: task_iris$nrow ## [1] 150 task_iris$ncol ## [1] 5 More information can be obtained through methods of the object, for example: task_iris$data() ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 ## 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 ## 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 ## --- ## 146: virginica 5.2 2.3 6.7 3.0 ## 147: virginica 5.0 1.9 6.3 2.5 ## 148: virginica 5.2 2.0 6.5 3.0 ## 149: virginica 5.4 2.3 6.2 3.4 ## 150: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 In mlr3, each row (observation) has a unique identifier is either an integer or character. These can be passed as arguments to the $data() method to select specific rows. The iris task uses integer row_ids: # iris uses integer row_ids head(task_iris$row_ids) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 # retrieve data for rows with ids 1, 51, and 101 task_iris$data(rows = c(1, 51, 101)) ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 ## 2: versicolor 4.7 1.4 7.0 3.2 ## 3: virginica 6.0 2.5 6.3 3.3 The mtcars task on the other hand uses names for its row_ids, encoded as character: task_mtcars = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;mtcars&quot;) head(task_mtcars$row_ids) ## [1] &quot;AMC Javelin&quot; &quot;Cadillac Fleetwood&quot; &quot;Camaro Z28&quot; ## [4] &quot;Chrysler Imperial&quot; &quot;Datsun 710&quot; &quot;Dodge Challenger&quot; # retrieve data for rows with id &quot;Datsun 710&quot; task_mtcars$data(rows = &quot;Datsun 710&quot;) ## mpg am carb cyl disp drat gear hp qsec vs wt ## 1: 22.8 1 1 4 108 3.85 4 93 18.61 1 2.32 Note that the method $data() only allows to read the data and does not modify it. Similarly, each column has an identifier or name. These names are stored in the public slots feature_names and target_names. Here “target” refers to the variable we want to predict and “feature” to the predictors for the task. task_iris$feature_names ## [1] &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; task_iris$target_names ## [1] &quot;Species&quot; The row_ids and column names can be combined when selecting a subset of the data: # retrieve data for rows 1, 51, and 101 and only select column &quot;Species&quot; task_iris$data(rows = c(1, 51, 101), cols = &quot;Species&quot;) ## Species ## 1: setosa ## 2: versicolor ## 3: virginica To extract the complete data from the task, we can simply convert it to a data.table: summary(as.data.table(task_iris)) ## Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## setosa :50 Min. :1.00 Min. :0.1 Min. :4.30 Min. :2.00 ## versicolor:50 1st Qu.:1.60 1st Qu.:0.3 1st Qu.:5.10 1st Qu.:2.80 ## virginica :50 Median :4.35 Median :1.3 Median :5.80 Median :3.00 ## Mean :3.76 Mean :1.2 Mean :5.84 Mean :3.06 ## 3rd Qu.:5.10 3rd Qu.:1.8 3rd Qu.:6.40 3rd Qu.:3.30 ## Max. :6.90 Max. :2.5 Max. :7.90 Max. :4.40 3.2.4.2 Roles (Rows and Columns) It is possible to assign roles to rows and columns. These roles affect the behavior of the task for different operations and provide additional meta-data for it. For example, the previously-constructed mtcars task has the following column roles: print(task_mtcars$col_roles) ## $feature ## [1] &quot;am&quot; &quot;carb&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; &quot;gear&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;wt&quot; ## ## $target ## [1] &quot;mpg&quot; ## ## $label ## character(0) ## ## $order ## character(0) ## ## $groups ## character(0) ## ## $weights ## character(0) To add the row names of mtcars as an additional feature, we first add them to the data table and then recreate the task. # with `keep.rownames`, data.table stores the row names in an extra column &quot;rn&quot; data = as.data.table(mtcars[, 1:3], keep.rownames = TRUE) task = TaskRegr$new(id = &quot;cars&quot;, backend = data, target = &quot;mpg&quot;) # we now have integer row_ids task$row_ids ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ## [26] 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 # there is a new feature called &quot;rn&quot; task$feature_names ## [1] &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;rn&quot; The row names are now a feature whose values are stored in the column “rn”. We include this here for educational purposes only; in general, there is no point in having a feature that uniquely identifies each row. Further, the character data type will cause problems with many types of machine learning algorithms. The identifier may be useful to label points in plots and identify outliers however. To use the new column for only this purpose, we will change the role of the “rn” column and remove it from the set of active features. We will assign it the “label” role, indicating that it should only be used for labeling points in plots or similar. task$feature_names ## [1] &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;rn&quot; task$set_col_role(&quot;rn&quot;, new_roles = &quot;label&quot;) # &quot;rn&quot; not listed as feature anymore task$feature_names ## [1] &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; # does not appear when we access the data anymore task$data(rows = 1:2) ## mpg cyl disp ## 1: 21 6 160 ## 2: 21 6 160 task$head(2) ## mpg cyl disp ## 1: 21 6 160 ## 2: 21 6 160 Changing the role does not change the underlying data, but only the view on it – the data is not copied in the code above. The view is changed in-place though, i.e. the task object itself is modified. Just like columns, it is also possible to assign different roles to rows. Rows can have two different roles: Role use: Rows that are generally available for model fitting (although they may also be used as test set in resampling). This is the default role. Role validation: Rows not used for training. Rows that have missing values in the target column during task creation are automatically set to the validation role. There are several reasons to hold some observations back or treat them differently: 1. It is often good practice to validate the final model on an external validation set to identify possible overfitting. 1. Some observations may be unlabeled, e.g. in competitions like Kaggle. These observations cannot be used for training a model, but can be used to get predictions. 3.2.4.3 Task Mutators As shown above, the task methods $set_col_role() and $set_row_role() change the view on the data and can be used to subset the task. The additional convenience method $filter() subsets the task based on row ids and .$select() subsets the task based on feature names. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) task$select(c(&quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Length&quot;)) # keep only these features task$filter(1:3) # keep only these rows task$head() ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1: setosa 5.1 3.5 ## 2: setosa 4.9 3.0 ## 3: setosa 4.7 3.2 While the methods discussed above allow to subset the data, the methods $rbind() and $cbind() allow to add extra rows and columns to a task. Again the original data is not changed; the additional rows or columns are only added to the view of the data. task$cbind(data.table(foo = letters[1:3])) # add column foo task$head() ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width foo ## 1: setosa 5.1 3.5 a ## 2: setosa 4.9 3.0 b ## 3: setosa 4.7 3.2 c "],
["learners.html", "3.3 Learners", " 3.3 Learners Objects of class mlr3::Learner provide a unified interface to many popular machine learning algorithms in R. They consist of methods to train and predict a model for a mlr3::Task and provide meta-information about the learners, such as the hyperparameters you can set.

For example, a learner has the property “missings” if it is able to handle missing feature values, and “importance” if it computes and allows to extract data on the relative importance of the features. predict_types: possible prediction types. For example, a classification learner can predict labels (“response”) or probabilities (“prob”). For a tabular overview of integrated learners, see Section 11.1.

Additionally, this chapter includes the following use-cases Functional Data Analysis using (WIP) Regression Analysis using (WIP) Survival Analysis using (WIP) Spatial Analysis using (WIP) 3.4.1 Basic concept 3.4.1.1 Creating Task and Learner Objects The first step is to generate the following mlr3 objects from the task dictionary and the learner dictionary, respectively: The classification task task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) A learner for the classification tree learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) 3.4.1.2 Setting up the train/test splits of the data (#split-data) It is common to train on a majority of the data. Here we use 80% of all available observations and predict on the remaining 20% observations. For this purpose, we create two index vectors: train_set = sample(task$nrow, 0.8 * task$nrow) test_set = setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), train_set) 3.4.1.3 Training the learner Next, we train the classification tree on the train set of the iris task using the $train() method of the Learner: learner$train(task, row_ids = train_set) This operation modifies the learner in-place. We can access the stored model via the field $model: print(learner$model) ## n= 120 ## ## node), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob) ## * denotes terminal node ## ## 1) root 120 79 versicolor (0.32500 0.34167 0.33333) ## 2) Petal.Length&lt; 2.45 39 0 setosa (1.00000 0.00000 0.00000) * ## 3) Petal.Length&gt;=2.45 81 40 versicolor (0.00000 0.50617 0.49383) ## 6) Petal.Width&lt; 1.75 44 4 versicolor (0.00000 0.90909 0.09091) * ## 7) Petal.Width&gt;=1.75 37 1 virginica (0.00000 0.02703 0.97297) * 3.4.1.4 Predicting After the model was trained, we use the remaining part of the data for prediction. Remember that we initially split the data in train_set and test_set. prediction = learner$predict(task, row_ids = test_set) print(prediction) ## &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 30 observations: ## row_id truth response ## 1 setosa setosa ## 2 setosa setosa ## 3 setosa setosa ## --- ## 145 virginica virginica ## 146 virginica virginica ## 147 virginica virginica The $predict() method of the Learner returns a Prediction object. More precise, as the learner is specialized for classification, a LearnerClassif returns a PredictionClassif object. A prediction objects holds The row ids of the test data, the respective true label of the target column and the respective predictions. The simplest way to extract this information is by converting to a data.table(): head(as.data.table(prediction)) ## row_id truth response ## 1: 1 setosa setosa ## 2: 2 setosa setosa ## 3: 3 setosa setosa ## 4: 7 setosa setosa ## 5: 8 setosa setosa ## 6: 9 setosa setosa For classification, you can also extract the confusion matrix: prediction$confusion ## truth ## response setosa versicolor virginica ## setosa 11 0 0 ## versicolor 0 9 1 ## virginica 0 0 9 3.4.1.4.1 Performance assessment The last step of an modeling is usually the performance assessment where we choose performance measure to quantify the predictions by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels. Available measures are stored in mlr_measures: mlr_measures ## &lt;DictionaryMeasure&gt; with 29 stored values ## Keys: classif.acc, classif.auc, classif.ce, classif.costs, classif.f1, ## classif.fdr, classif.fn, classif.fnr, classif.for, classif.fp, ## classif.fpr, classif.npv, classif.ppv, classif.precision, ## classif.recall, classif.sensitivity, classif.specificity, classif.tn, ## classif.tnr, classif.tp, classif.tpr, oob_error, regr.mae, regr.mse, ## regr.rmse, selected_features, time_both, time_predict, time_train We select the accuracy (classif.acc) and call the method $score() of the Prediction object: measure = mlr_measures$get(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) prediction$score(measure) ## classif.ce ## 0.03333 Note that, if no measure is specified, classification defaults to classification error (classif.ce) and regression defaults to the mean squared error (regr.mse).

["resampling.html", "3.5 Resampling", " 3.5 Resampling 3.5.1 Settings In this example we use the iris task and a simple classification tree (package rpart). task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) When performing resampling with a dataset, we first need to define which approach should be used. The resampling strategies of mlr3 can be queried using the .$keys() method of the mlr_resamplings dictionary. mlr_resamplings ## &lt;DictionaryResampling&gt; with 7 stored values ## Keys: bootstrap, custom, cv, cv3, holdout, repeated_cv, subsampling Additional resampling methods for special use cases will be available via extension packages, such as mlr3survival for survival analysis or mlr3spatiotemporal for spatial data (still in development). The model fit conducted in the train/predict/score chapter is equivalent to a “holdout”, so let’s consider this one first. resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;) print(resampling) ## &lt;ResamplingHoldout&gt; with 1 iterations ## * Instantiated: FALSE ## * Parameters: ratio=0.6667 Note that the Instantianated field is set to FALSE. This means we did not actually apply the strategy on a dataset yet but just performed a dry-run. Applying the strategy on a dataset is done in section next Instantation. By default we get a .66/.33 split of the data. There are two ways how the ratio can be changed: Overwriting the slot in .$param_set$values using a named list. resampling$param_set$values = list(ratio = 0.8) Specifying the resampling parameters directly during construction using the param_vals argument: mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;, param_vals = list(ratio = 0.8)) ## &lt;ResamplingHoldout&gt; with 1 iterations ## * Instantiated: FALSE ## * Parameters: ratio=0.8 3.5.2 Instantiation So far we just set the stage and selected the resampling strategy. To actually perform the splitting, we need to apply the settings on a dataset. This can be done in two ways: Manually by calling the method .$instantiate() on a Task resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;cv&quot;, param_vals = list(folds = 3L)) resampling$instantiate(task) resampling$iters ## [1] 3 resampling$train_set(1) ## [1] 2 4 10 11 13 14 16 17 18 21 22 23 33 34 41 42 43 52 ## [19] 61 62 64 66 74 75 77 78 79 81 87 88 89 92 99 100 102 105 ## [37] 110 115 116 119 121 124 128 129 134 137 138 142 147 149 1 3 7 8 ## [55] 9 15 24 27 29 30 31 36 37 38 40 44 46 51 55 57 58 65 ## [73] 68 73 82 83 85 86 91 97 98 103 104 107 109 111 113 114 126 131 ## [91] 132 133 136 140 141 144 145 146 148 150 Automatically by passing the resampling object to resample(). Here, the splitting is done within the resample() call based on the supplied Task. learner1 = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) # simple classification tree learner2 = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;) # featureless learner, prediction majority class rr1 = resample(task, learner1, resampling) rr2 = resample(task, learner2, resampling) setequal(rr1$resampling$train_set(1), rr2$resampling$train_set(1)) ## [1] TRUE If you want to compare multiple learners, you should use the same resampling per task to reduce the variance of the performance estimation (method 1). If you use method 2 (and do not instantiate manually before), the resampling splits will differ between both runs. If you aim is to compare different Task, Learner or Resampling, you are better off using the benchmark() function. It is basically a wrapper around resample() simplifying the handling of multiple settings. If you discover this only after you’ve run multiple resample() calls, don’t worry - you can transform multiple single ResampleResult objects into a BenchmarkResult (explained later) using the .$combine() method. 3.5.3 Execution With a Task, a Learner and Resampling object we can call resample() and create a ResampleResult object. rr = resample(task, learner, resampling) print(rr) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 3 iterations ## * Task: iris ## * Learner: classif.rpart ## * Performance: 0.053 [classif.ce] ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations Before we go into more detail, let’s change the resampling to a “3-fold cross-validation” to better illustrate what operations are possible with a ResampleResult. Additionally, we tell resample() to keep the fitted models via a control object (see mlr_control()): resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;cv&quot;, param_vals = list(folds = 3L)) ctrl = mlr_control(store_models = TRUE) rr = resample(task, learner, resampling, ctrl = ctrl) print(rr) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 3 iterations ## * Task: iris ## * Learner: classif.rpart ## * Performance: 0.060 [classif.ce] ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations The following operations are supported with ResampleResult objects: Extract the performance for the individual resampling iterations: rr$performance(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) ## task task_id learner learner_id resampling ## 1: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; iris &lt;LearnerClassifRpart&gt; classif.rpart &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## 2: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; iris &lt;LearnerClassifRpart&gt; classif.rpart &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## 3: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; iris &lt;LearnerClassifRpart&gt; classif.rpart &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## resampling_id iteration prediction classif.ce ## 1: cv 1 &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; 0.06 ## 2: cv 2 &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; 0.06 ## 3: cv 3 &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; 0.06 Extract and inspect the resampling splits: rr$resampling ## &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; with 3 iterations ## * Instantiated: TRUE ## * Parameters: folds=3 rr$resampling$iters ## [1] 3 rr$resampling$test_set(1) ## [1] 2 3 9 12 18 25 26 37 41 42 44 49 50 51 55 57 59 62 65 ## [20] 69 70 73 74 75 76 78 80 83 86 88 94 96 99 104 112 113 118 123 ## [39] 125 130 132 133 135 136 139 142 144 145 146 147 rr$resampling$train_set(3) ## [1] 2 3 9 12 18 25 26 37 41 42 44 49 50 51 55 57 59 62 ## [19] 65 69 70 73 74 75 76 78 80 83 86 88 94 96 99 104 112 113 ## [37] 118 123 125 130 132 133 135 136 139 142 144 145 146 147 5 6 8 11 ## [55] 13 14 17 19 22 23 28 29 30 32 33 34 43 45 46 47 54 56 ## [73] 58 61 63 66 72 77 79 81 85 91 93 103 105 106 107 110 114 117 ## [91] 119 120 124 128 134 138 141 148 149 150 Retrieve the learner of a specific iteration and inspect it: lrn = rr$learners[[1]] lrn$model ## n= 100 ## ## node), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob) ## * denotes terminal node ## ## 1) root 100 63 setosa (0.37000 0.30000 0.33000) ## 2) Petal.Length&lt; 2.6 37 0 setosa (1.00000 0.00000 0.00000) * ## 3) Petal.Length&gt;=2.6 63 30 virginica (0.00000 0.47619 0.52381) ## 6) Petal.Width&lt; 1.65 31 2 versicolor (0.00000 0.93548 0.06452) * ## 7) Petal.Width&gt;=1.65 32 1 virginica (0.00000 0.03125 0.96875) * 3.5.4 Custom resampling Sometimes it is necessary to perform resampling with custom splits. If you want to do that because you are coming from a specific modeling field, take a look first at the mlr3 extension packages to make sure your custom resampling method hasn’t been implemented already. If your custom resampling method is widely used in your field, feel welcome to integrate it into one of the existing mlr3 extension packages or create your own one. A manual resampling instance can be created using the &quot;custom&quot; template from the mlr_resamplings dictionary. resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;custom&quot;) resampling$instantiate(task, list(c(1:10, 51:60, 101:110)), list(c(11:20, 61:70, 111:120)) ) resampling$iters ## [1] 1 resampling$train_set(1) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 ## [20] 60 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 resampling$test_set(1) ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 ## [20] 70 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 "],
["benchmarking.html", "3.6 Benchmarking", " 3.6 Benchmarking Comparing the performance of different learners on multiple tasks and/or different resampling schemes is a recurrent task. This operation is usually referred to as “benchmarking” in the field of machine-learning. mlr3 offers the benchmark() function for convenience. 3.6.1 Design Creation In mlr3 we require you to supply a “design” of your benchmark experiment. By “design” we essentially mean the matrix of settings you want to execute. A “design” consists of Task, Learner and Resampling. Additionally, you can supply different Measure along side. Here, we call benchmark() to perform a single holdout split on a single task and two learners. We use the expand_grid() function to create an exhaustive design and properly instantiate the resampling: library(data.table) design = expand_grid( tasks = mlr_tasks$mget(&quot;iris&quot;), learners = mlr_learners$mget(c(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, &quot;classif.featureless&quot;)), resamplings = mlr_resamplings$mget(&quot;holdout&quot;) ) print(design) ## task learner resampling ## 1: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRpart&gt; &lt;ResamplingHoldout&gt; ## 2: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifFeatureless&gt; &lt;ResamplingHoldout&gt; bmr = benchmark(design) Note that the holdout splits have been automatically instantiated for each row of the design. As a result, the rpart learner used a different training set than the featureless learner. However, for comparison of learners you usually want the learners to see the same splits into train and test sets. To overcome this issue, the resampling strategy needs to be manually instantiated before creating the design. While the interface of benchmark() allows full flexibility, the creation of such design tables can be tedious. Therefore, mlr3 provides a convenience function to quickly generate design tables and instantiate resampling strategies in an exhaustive grid fashion: expand_grid(). # get some example tasks tasks = mlr_tasks$mget(c(&quot;pima&quot;, &quot;sonar&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;)) # get some measures: accuracy (acc) and area under the curve (auc) measures = mlr_measures$mget(c(&quot;classif.acc&quot;, &quot;classif.auc&quot;)) # get a featureless learner and a classification tree # let both learners predict probabilities learners = mlr_learners$mget(c(&quot;classif.featureless&quot;, &quot;classif.rpart&quot;), predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) # compare via 3-fold cross validation resamplings = mlr_resamplings$mget(&quot;cv3&quot;) # create a BenchmarkDesign object design = expand_grid(tasks, learners, resamplings) print(design) ## task learner resampling ## 1: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifFeatureless&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## 2: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRpart&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## 3: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifFeatureless&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## 4: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRpart&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## 5: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifFeatureless&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; ## 6: &lt;TaskClassif&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifRpart&gt; &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; 3.6.2 Execution and Aggregation of Results After the benchmark design is ready, we can directly call benchmark() # execute the benchmark bmr = benchmark(design) Note that we did not instantiate the resampling instance, but expand_grid() took care of it for us: each resampling strategy is instantiated for each task during the construction of the exhaustive grid. After the benchmark, we can calculate and aggregate the performance with .$aggregate(): bmr$aggregate(measures) ## hash resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id ## 1: fc190d98658b7cf8 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; pima classif.featureless cv3 ## 2: c833fe5785823951 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; pima classif.rpart cv3 ## 3: dc4e611a860a26c3 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; sonar classif.featureless cv3 ## 4: 7f743903470bf9ba &lt;ResampleResult&gt; sonar classif.rpart cv3 ## 5: 3f9b4e3b2e34fd43 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; spam classif.featureless cv3 ## 6: 78c42fcfcc3a97bf &lt;ResampleResult&gt; spam classif.rpart cv3 ## classif.acc classif.auc ## 1: 0.6510 0.5000 ## 2: 0.7331 0.7652 ## 3: 0.5337 0.5000 ## 4: 0.7114 0.7851 ## 5: 0.6060 0.5000 ## 6: 0.8978 0.8988 We can aggregate the results further. For example, we might be interested which learner performed best over all tasks. Since we have data.table object here, we could do the following: bmr$aggregate(measures)[, list(acc = mean(classif.acc), auc = mean(classif.auc)), by = &quot;learner_id&quot;] ## learner_id acc auc ## 1: classif.featureless 0.5969 0.5000 ## 2: classif.rpart 0.7808 0.8164 Alternatively, we can also use the tidyverse approach: library(&quot;magrittr&quot;) requireNamespace(&quot;dplyr&quot;) requireNamespace(&quot;tibble&quot;) bmr$aggregate(measures) %&gt;% tibble::as_tibble() %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(learner_id) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(acc = mean(classif.acc), auc = mean(classif.auc)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## learner_id acc auc ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 classif.featureless 0.597 0.5 ## 2 classif.rpart 0.781 0.816 Unsurprisingly, the classification tree outperformed the featureless learner. 3.6.3 Converting specific benchmark objects to resample objects A BenchmarkResult object is essentially a collection of multiple ResampleResult objects. As these are stored in a column of the aggregated data.table(), we can easily extract them: tab = bmr$aggregate(measures) rr = tab[task_id == &quot;spam&quot; &amp; learner_id == &quot;classif.rpart&quot;]$resample_result[[1]] print(rr) ## &lt;ResampleResult&gt; of 3 iterations ## * Task: spam ## * Learner: classif.rpart ## * Performance: 0.102 [classif.ce] ## * Warnings: 0 in 0 iterations ## * Errors: 0 in 0 iterations We can now investigate this resampling and even single resampling iterations using one of the approach shown in the previous section: rr$aggregate(measure) ## classif.ce ## 0.1022 # get the iteration with worst AUC worst = rr$performance(measures) %&gt;% tibble::as_tibble() %&gt;% dplyr::slice(which.min(classif.auc)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(classif.auc, iteration) # get the corresponding learner lrn = rr$learners[[worst$iteration]] lrn ## &lt;LearnerClassifRpart:classif.rpart&gt; ## * Model: - ## * Parameters: xval=0 ## * Packages: rpart ## * Predict Type: prob ## * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, character, factor, ordered ## * Properties: importance, missings, multiclass, selected_features, ## twoclass, weights "],
["binary.html", "3.7 Binary classification", " 3.7 Binary classification Classification problems with a target variable containing only two classes are called “binary”. For such, you can specify the positive class within the classification task object during task creation. If not explicitly set during construction, the positive class defaults to the first level of the target variable. # during construction data(&quot;Sonar&quot;, package = &quot;mlbench&quot;) task = TaskClassif$new(id = &quot;Sonar&quot;, Sonar, target = &quot;Class&quot;, positive = &quot;R&quot;) # switch positive class to level &#39;M&#39; task$positive = &quot;M&quot; 3.7.1 ROC Curve and Thresholds ROC Analysis – which stands for “receiver operating characteristics” – is a subfield of machine learning which studies the evaluation of binary prediction systems. We saw earlier that we can retrieve the confusion matrix of a Prediction by accessing the $confusion field: learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) pred = learner$train(task)$predict(task) C = pred$confusion print(C) ## truth ## response M R ## M 95 10 ## R 16 87 The confusion matrix contains the counts of correct and incorrect class assignments, grouped by class labels. In the columns are the true (observed) labels, in the rows are the predicted labels. The positive is always the first row or column in the confusion matrix. Thus, the element in \\(C_{11}\\) is the number of times our model predicted the positive class and was right about it. Analogously, the element in \\(C_{22}\\) is the number of times our model predicted the negative class and was also right about it. The elements on the diagonal are called True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN). The element \\(C_{12}\\) is the number of times we falsely predicted a positive label, and is called False Positives (FP). The element \\(C_{21}\\) is called False Negatives (FN). We can now normalize in rows and columns of the confusion matrix to derive several informative metrics: True Positive Rate (TPR): How many of the true positives did we predict as positive? True Negative Rate (TNR): How many of the true negatives did we predict as negative? Positive Predictive Value PPV: If we predict positive how likely is it a true positive? Negative Predictive Value NPV: If we predict negative how likely is it a true negative? Source: Wikipedia It is difficult to achieve a high TPR and low FPR simultaneously, so we use them for constructing the ROC Curve. We characterize a classifier by its TPR and FPR values and plot them in a coordinate system. The best classifier lies on the top-left corner while the diagonal is the worst, where classifiers produce random labels (with different proportions). If each positive \\(x\\) will be randomly classified with 25% as “positive”, we get a TPR of 0.25. If we assign each negative \\(x\\) randomly to “positive” we get a FPR of 0.25. In practice, we should never obtain a classifier below the diagonal, as inverting the predicted labels will result in a reflection at the diagonal. A scoring classifier is a model which outputs scores or probabilities, instead of discrete labels, and nearly all modern classifiers can do that. Thresholding flexibly converts measured probabilities to labels. Predict \\(1\\) (positive class) if \\(\\hat{f}(x) &gt; \\tau\\) else predict \\(0\\). Normally we could use \\(\\tau = 0.5\\) to convert, but for imbalanced or cost-sensitive situations another threshold could be better. After thresholding, any metric defined on labels can be used. For mlr3 prediction objects, the ROC curve can easily be created using third party packages such as the precrec package: library(precrec) evaluated = evalmod( scores = pred$prob[, task$positive], label = pred$truth, posclass = task$positive ) # TPR vs FPR / Sensitivity vs (1 - Specificity) ggplot2::autoplot(evaluated, curvetype = &quot;ROC&quot;) # Precision vs Recall ggplot2::autoplot(evaluated, curvetype = &quot;PRC&quot;) 3.7.2 Threshold Tuning "],

["tuning.html", "4.1 Hyperparameter Tuning", " 4.1 Hyperparameter Tuning Hyperparameter tuning is supported via the extension package mlr3tuning. The heart of mlr3tuning are the R6 classes mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator and the Tuner* classes. They store the settings, perform the tuning and save the results. 4.1.1 The Performance Evaluator class The mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator class requires the following inputs from the user: Task Learner Resampling Measure paradox::ParamSet It is similar to resample and benchmark with the additional requirement of a “Parameter Set” (paradox::ParamSet ) specifying the Hyperparameters of the given learner which should be optimized. An exemplary definition could looks as follows: library(mlr3tuning) task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;) measures = mlr_measures$mget(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new(params = list( paradox::ParamDbl$new(&quot;cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1), paradox::ParamInt$new(&quot;minsplit&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 10))) pe = PerformanceEvaluator$new( task = task, learner = learner, resampling = resampling, measures = measures, param_set = param_set ) Evaluation of Single Parameter Settings Using the method .$eval(), the mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator is able to tune a specific set of hyperparameters on the given inputs. The parameters have to be handed over wrapped in a data.table: pe$eval(data.table::data.table(cp = 0.05, minsplit = 5)) The results are stored in a BenchmarkResult class within the pe object. Note that this is the “bare bone” concept of using hyperparameters during Resampling. Usually you want to optimize the parameters in an automated fashion. 4.1.2 Tuning Hyperparameter Spaces Most often you do not want to only check the performance of fixed hyperparameter settings sequentially but optimize the outcome using different hyperparameter choices in an automated way. To achieve this, we need a definition of the search spaced that should be optimized. Let’s use again the space we defined in the introduction. paradox::ParamSet$new(params = list( paradox::ParamDbl$new(&quot;cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1), paradox::ParamInt$new(&quot;minsplit&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 10))) To start the tuning, we still need to select how the optimization should take place - in other words, we need to choose the optimization algorithm. The following algorithms are currently implemented in mlr3: Grid Search (mlr3tuning::TunerGridSearch) Random Search (mlr3tuning::TunerRandomSearch) (Bergstra and Bengio 2012) Generalized Simulated Annealing (mlr3tuning::TunerGenSA) In this example we will use a simple “Grid Search”. Since we have only numeric parameters and specified the upper and lower bounds for the search space, mlr3tuning::TunerGridSearch will create a grid of equally-sized steps. By default, mlr3tuning::TunerGridSearch creates ten equal-sized steps. The number of steps can be changed with the resolution argument. In this example we use 15 steps and create a new class mlr3tuning::TunerGridSearch using the mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator pe and the resolution. tuner_gs = TunerGridSearch$new(pe, resolution = 15) Oh! The error message tells us that we need to specify an addition argument called terminator. 4.1.3 Defining the Terminator What is a “Terminator”? The mlr3tuning::Terminator defines when the tuning should be stopped. This setting can have various instances: Terminate after a given time (mlr3tuning::TerminatorRuntime) Terminate after a given amount of iterations (mlr3tuning::TerminatorEvaluations) Terminate after a specific performance is reached (mlr3tuning::Performance) Often enough one termination criterion is not enough. For example, you will not know beforehand if all of your given evaluations will finish within a given amount of time. This highly depends on the Learner and the paradox::ParamSet given. However, you might not want to exceed a certain tuning time for each learner. In this case, it makes sense to combine both criteria using mlr3tuning::TerminatorMultiplexer. Tuning will stop as soon as one Terminator signals to be finished. In the following example we create two terminators and then combine them into one: tr = TerminatorRuntime$new(5) te = TerminatorEvaluations$new(max_evaluations = 50) tm = TerminatorMultiplexer$new(list(te, tr)) tm 4.1.4 Executing the Tuning Now that we have all required inputs (paradox::ParamSet, mlr3tuning::Terminator and the optimization algorithm), we can perform the hyperparameter tuning. The first step is to create the respective “Tuner” class, here mlr3tuning::TunerGridSearch. tuner_gs = TunerGridSearch$new(pe = pe, terminator = tm, resolution = 15) After it has been initialized, we can call its member function .$tune() to run the tuning. tuner_gs$tune() .$tune() simply performs a benchmark on the parameter values generated by the tuner and writes the results into a BenchmarkResult object which is stored in field .$bmr of the mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator object that we passed to it. 4.1.5 Inspecting Results During the .$tune() call not only the BenchmarkResult output was written to the .$bmr slot of the mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator but also the mlr3tuning::Terminator got updated. We can take a look by directly printing the mlr3tuning::Terminator object: print(tm) We can easily see that all evaluations were executed before the time limit kicked in. Now let’s take a closer look at the actual tuning result. It can be queried using .$tune_result() from the respective mlr3tuning::Tuner class that generated it. Internally, the function scrapes the data from the BenchmarkResult that was generated during tuning and stored in .$pe$bmr. tuner_gs$tune_result() It returns the scored performance and the values of the optimized hyperparameters. Note that each measure “knows” if it was minimized or maximized during tuning: measures$classif.ce$minimize A summary of the BenchmarkResult created by the tuning can be queried using the .$aggregate() function of the Tuner class. tuner_gs$aggregate() Now the optimized hyperparameters can be used to create a new Learner and train it on the full dataset. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;, param_vals = list( xval = tuner_gs$tune_result()$values$xval, cp = tuner_gs$tune_result()$values$cp) ) learner$train(task) 4.1.6 Automating the Tuning The steps shown above can be executed in a more convenient way using the mlr3tuning::AutoTuner class. This class gathers all the steps from above into a single call and uses the optimized hyperparameters from the tuning to create a new learner. Requirements: Task Learner Resampling Measure Parameter Set Terminator Tuning method Tuning settings (optional) task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;) measures = mlr_measures$mget(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new( params = list(paradox::ParamDbl$new(&quot;cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1))) terminator = TerminatorEvaluations$new(5) at = mlr3tuning::AutoTuner$new(learner, resampling, measures = measures, param_set, terminator, tuner = TunerGridSearch, tuner_settings = list(resolution = 10L)) at$train(task) at$learner Note that you can also pass the AutoTuner to resample() or benchmark(). By doing so, the AutoTuner will do its resampling for tuning on the training set of the respective split of the outer resampling. This is called nested resampling. To compare the tuned learner with the learner using its default, we can use benchmark(). bmr = benchmark(expand_grid(&quot;iris&quot;, list(at, &quot;classif.rpart&quot;), &quot;cv3&quot;)) bmr$aggregate(measures) 4.1.7 Summary Use PerformanceEvaluator$eval() for manual execution of parameters in Resampling Define a Tuner of your choice using a mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator with the following inputs Learner Task Resampling paradox::ParamSet mlr3tuning::Terminator Inspect the tuning result using Tuner*$tune_result() Get a summary view of all runs based on the BenchmarkResult object created during tuning using Tuner*$aggregate() The AutoTuner class is a convenience wrapper that gathers all steps into one function References "],
["fs.html", "4.2 Feature Selection / Filtering", " 4.2 Feature Selection / Filtering Often, data sets include a large number of features. The technique of extracting a subset of relevant features is called “feature selection”. Feature selection can enhance the interpretability of the model, speed up the learning process and improve the learner performance. Different approaches exist to identify the relevant features. In the literature two different approaches exist: One is called “Filtering” and the other approach is often referred to as “feature subset selection” or “wrapper methods”. What are the differences (Chandrashekar and Sahin 2014)? Filter: An external algorithm computes a rank of the variables (e.g. based on the correlation to the response). Then, features are subsetted by a certain criteria, e.g. an absolute number or a percentage of the number of variables. The selected features will then be used to fit a model (with optional hyperparameters selected by tuning). This calculation is usually cheaper than “feature subset selection” in terms of computation time. Feature subset selection: Here, no ranking of features is done. Features are selected by a (random) subset of the data. Then, a model is fit and the performance is checked. This is done for a lot of feature combinations in a CV setting and the best combination is reported. This method is very computational intense as a lot of models are fitted. Also, strictly all these models would need to be tuned before the performance is estimated which would require an additional nested level in a CV setting. After all this, the selected subset of features is again fitted (with optional hyperparameters selected by tuning). There is also a third approach which can be attributed to the “filter” family: The embedded feature-selection methods of some Learner. Read more about how to use these in section embedded feature-selection methods. Ensemble filters built upon the idea of stacking single filter methods. These are not yet implemented. All feature selection related functionality is implemented via the extension package mlr3filters. 4.2.1 Filters Filter methods assign an importance value to each feature. Based on these values the features can be ranked and a feature subset can be selected. There is a list of all implemented filter methods in the Appendix. 4.2.1.1 Calculating filter values Currently, only classification and regression tasks are supported. The first step it to create a new R object using the class of the desired filter method. Each object of class Filter has a .$calculate() method which calculates the ranking of the features. This method can be executed manually but is also run implicitly in the background if the actual filter functions (.$filter_nfeat(), .$filter_frac(), .$filter_cutoff()) are executed. All functions require a Task and return both the calculated filter values for all features and subset the supplied task: library(mlr3filters) filter = FilterJMIM$new() task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) filter$calculate(task) as.data.table(filter) ## feature score ## 1: Sepal.Length 1.0401 ## 2: Petal.Width 0.9894 ## 3: Petal.Length 0.9881 ## 4: Sepal.Width 0.8314 4.2.2 Wrapper Methods Work in progress :) - via package mlr3fswrap 4.2.3 Embedded Methods All Learner with the property “importance” come with integrated feature selection methods. You can find a list of all learners with this property in the Appendix. For some learners the desired filter method needs to be set during learner creation. For example, learner classif.ranger (in mlr3learners comes with multiple integrated methods. See the help page of ranger::ranger. To use method “impurity”, you need to set it via the param_vals argument: library(mlr3learners) lrn = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.ranger&quot;, param_vals = list(importance = &quot;impurity&quot;)) Now you can use the mlr3filters::FilterImportance class for algorithm-embedded methods to filter a Task. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) filter = FilterImportance$new(learner = lrn) filter$calculate(task) head(as.data.table(filter), 3) ## feature score ## 1: Petal.Width 44.789 ## 2: Petal.Length 42.370 ## 3: Sepal.Length 9.937 4.2.4 Ensemble Methods Work in progress :) References "],
["nested-resampling.html", "4.3 Nested Resampling", " 4.3 Nested Resampling 4.3.1 Introduction In order to obtain unbiased performance estimates for a learners, all parts of the model building (preprocessing and model selection steps) should be included in the resampling, i.e., repeated for every pair of training/test data. For steps that themselves require resampling like hyperparameter tuning or feature-selection (via the wrapper approach) this results in two nested resampling loops. The graphic above illustrates nested resampling for parameter tuning with 3-fold cross-validation in the outer and 4-fold cross-validation in the inner loop. In the outer resampling loop, we have three pairs of training/test sets. On each of these outer training sets parameter tuning is done, thereby executing the inner resampling loop. This way, we get one set of selected hyperparameters for each outer training set. Then the learner is fitted on each outer training set using the corresponding selected hyperparameters and its performance is evaluated on the outer test sets. In mlr3, you can get nested resampling for free without programming any looping by using the mlr3tuning::AutoTuner class. This works as follows: Generate a wrapped Learner via class mlr3tuning::AutoTuner or mlr3filters::AutoSelect (not yet implemented). Specify all required settings - see section “Automating the Tuning” for help. Call function resample() or benchmark() with the created Learner. You can freely combine different inner and outer resampling strategies. A common setup is prediction and performance evaluation on a fixed outer test set. This can be achieved by passing the Resampling strategy (mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;)) as the outer resampling instance to either resample() or benchmark(). The inner resampling strategy could be a cross-validation one (mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;cv&quot;)) as the sizes of the outer training sets might differ. Per default, the inner resample description is instantiated once for every outer training set. Nested resampling is computationally expensive. For this reason in the examples shown below we use relatively small search spaces and a low number of resampling iterations. In practice, you normally have to increase both. As this is computationally intensive you might want to have a look at section parallelization. 4.3.2 Execution To optimize hyperparameters or conduct features-selection in a nested resampling you need to create learners using either the mlr3tuning::AutoTuner class, or the mlr3filters::AutoSelect class (not yet implemented). We use the example from section “Automating the Tuning” and pipe the resulting learner into a resample() call. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;holdout&quot;) measures = mlr_measures$mget(&quot;classif.ce&quot;) param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new( params = list(paradox::ParamDbl$new(&quot;cp&quot;, lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1))) terminator = TerminatorEvaluations$new(5) at = mlr3tuning::AutoTuner$new(learner, resampling, measures = measures, param_set, terminator, tuner = TunerGridSearch, tuner_settings = list(resolution = 10L)) at$store_bmr = TRUE Now construct the resample() call: resampling_outer = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;cv3&quot;) rr = resample(task = task, learner = at, resampling = resampling_outer) 4.3.3 Evaluation With the created ResampleResult we can now inspect the executed resampling iterations more closely. See also section Resampling for more detailed information about ResampleResult objects. For example, we can query the aggregated performance result: rr$aggregate() We can also query the tuning result of any learner using the $tune_path field of the AutoTuner class stored in the ResampleResult container rr. Note: This only works if store_bmr was set to TRUE in the AutoTuner object. rr$learners[[1]]$tune_path Check for any errors in the folds during execution (if there is not output, warnings or errors recorded, this is an empty data.table(): rr$errors Or take a look at the confusion matrix of the joined predictions: rr$prediction$confusion "],
["pipelines.html", "5 Pipelines", " 5 Pipelines mlr3pipelines is a dataflow programming toolkit for machine learning in R utilizing the mlr3pipelines package. A more in-deptth and technically oriented vignette can be found in the mlr3pipeline vignette. Machine learning workflows can be written as directed “Graphs”/“Pipelines” that represent data flows between preprocessing, model fitting, and ensemble learning units in an expressive and intuitive language. We will most often use the term “Graph” in this manual but it can interchangeably be used with “pipeline” or “workflow”. Single computational steps can be represented as so-called PipeOps, which can then be connected with directed edges in a Graph. The scope of mlr3pipelines is still growing. Currently supported features are: Simple data manipulation and preprocessing operations, e.g. PCA, feature filtering, imputation Task subsampling for speed and outcome class imbalance handling mlr3 Learner operations for prediction and stacking Ensemble methods and aggregation of predictions Additionally, we implement several meta operators that can be used to construct powerful pipelines: - Simultaneous path branching (data going both ways) - Alternative path branching (data going one specific way, controlled by hyperparameters) An extensive introduction to creating custom PipeOps (PO’s) can be found in the technical introduction. Using methods from mlr3tuning, it is even possible to simultaneously optimize parameters of multiple processing units. A predecessor to this package is the mlrCPO package, which works with mlr 2.x. Other packages that provide, to varying degree, some preprocessing functionality or machine learning domain specific language, are the caret package and the related recipies project, and the dplyr package.

["pipe-nonlinear.html", "5.5 Non-Linear Graphs", " 5.5 Non-Linear Graphs The Graphs seen so far all have a linear structure. Some POs may have multiple input or output channels. These make it possible to create non-linear Graphs with alternative paths taken by the data. Possible types are Branching: Splitting of a node into several paths, useful for example when comparing multiple feature-selection methods (pca, filters). Only one path will be executed. Copying: Splitting of a node into several paths, all paths will be executed (sequentially). Parallel execution is not yet supported. Stacking: Single graphs are stacked onto each other, i.e. the output of one Graph is the input for another. In machine learning this means that the prediction of one Graph is used as input for another Graph 5.5.1 Branching &amp; Copying The PipeOpBranch and PipeOpUnbranch POs make it possible to specify multiple alternative paths.

Before we go into details, we split the task into train and test indices. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) train.idx = sample(seq_len(task$nrow), 120) test.idx = setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), train.idx) 5.5.2.1 Bagging We first examine Bagging introduced by (Breiman 1996). The basic idea is to create multiple predictors and then aggregate those to a single, more powerful predictor. “… multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets” (Breiman 1996) Bagging then aggregates a set of predictors by averaging (regression) or majority vote (classification). The idea behind bagging is, that a set of weak, but different predictors can be combined in order to arrive at a single, better predictor. We can achieve this by downsampling our data before training a learner, repeating this for say 10 times and then performing a majority vote on the predictions. First, we create a simple pipeline, that uses PipeOpSubsample before a PipeOpLearner is trained: single_pred = PipeOpSubsample$new(param_vals = list(frac = 0.7)) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)) We can now copy this operation 10 times using greplicate . pred_set = greplicate(single_pred, 10L) Afterwards we need to aggregate the 10 pipelines to form a single model: bagging = pred_set %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpMajorityVote$new(innum = 10L) and plot again to see what happens: bagging$plot(html = TRUE) %&gt;% visInteraction(zoomView = FALSE) # disable zoom This pipeline can again be used in conjunction with GraphLearner in order for Bagging to be used like a Learner. baglrn = GraphLearner$new(bagging) baglrn$train(task, train.idx) baglrn$predict(task, test.idx) #&gt; &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 30 observations: #&gt; row_id truth response #&gt; 4 setosa setosa #&gt; 5 setosa setosa #&gt; 6 setosa setosa #&gt; --- #&gt; 138 virginica virginica #&gt; 146 virginica virginica #&gt; 148 virginica virginica In conjunction with different Backends, this can be a very powerful tool. In cases when the data does not fully fit in memory, we can obtain a fraction of the data for each learner from a DataBackend and then aggregate predictions over all learners. 5.5.2.2 Stacking Stacking (Wolpert 1992) is another technique that can improve model performance. The basic idea behind stacking is the use of predictions from one model as features for a subsequent model to possibly improve performance. As an example we can train a decision tree and use the predictions from this model in conjunction with the original features in order to train an additional model on top. In order to limit overfitting, we additionally do not predict on the original predictions of the learner, but instead on out-of-bag predictions. To do all this, we can use PipeOpLearnerCV . PipeOpLearnerCV performs nested cross-validation on the training data, fitting a model in each fold. Each of the models is then used to predict on the out-of-fold data. As a result, we obtain predictions for every data point in our input data. We first create a “level 0” learner, which is used to extract a lower level prediction. We additionally clone() the learner object to obtain a copy of the learner, and set a custom id for the PipeOp . lrn = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) lrn_0 = PipeOpLearnerCV$new(lrn$clone()) lrn_0$id = &quot;rpart_cv&quot; Additionally, we use a FIXME in parallel to the “level 0” learner, in order to send the unchanged Task to the next level, where it is then combined with the predictions from our decision tree learner. level_0 = gunion(list(lrn_0, PipeOpNULL$new())) Afterwards, we want to concatenate the predictions from PipeOpLearnerCV and the original Task using PipeOpFeatureUnion . combined = level_0 %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpFeatureUnion$new(2) We can now train another learner on top of the combined features. stack = combined %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearner$new(lrn$clone()) stack$plot(html = TRUE) %&gt;% visInteraction(zoomView = FALSE) # disable zoom stacklrn = GraphLearner$new(stack) stacklrn$train(task, train.idx) stacklrn$predict(task, test.idx) In this vignette, we showed a very simple usecase for stacking. In many real-world applications, stacking is done for multiple levels and on multiple representations of the dataset. On a lower level, different preprocessing methods can be defined in conjunction with several learners. On a higher level, we can then combine those predictions in order to form a very powerful model. 5.5.2.3 Multilevel Stacking In order to showcase the power of mlr3pipelines, we will show a more complicated stacking example. In this case, we train a glmnet and 2 different rpart models (some transform its inputs using PipeOpPCA ) on our task in the “level 0” and concatenate them with the original features (via FIXME). The result is then passed on to &quot;level 1&quot;, where we copy the concatenated features 3 times and put this task into a _rpart_ and a _glmnet_ model. Additionally, we keep a version of the &quot;level 0&quot; output (via FIXME ) and pass this on to “level 2”. In “level 2” we simply concatenate all “level 1” outputs and train a final decision tree. rprt = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) rprt$predict_type = &quot;prob&quot; glmn = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.glmnet&quot;) glmn$predict_type = &quot;prob&quot; # Create Learner CV Operators lrn_0 = PipeOpLearnerCV$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_cv_1&quot;) lrn_0$values$maxdepth = 5L lrn_1 = PipeOpPCA$new(id = &quot;pca1&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearnerCV$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_cv_2&quot;) lrn_1$values$maxdepth = 1L lrn_2 = PipeOpPCA$new(id = &quot;pca2&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearnerCV$new(glmn) # Union them with a PipeOpNULL to keep original features level_0 = gunion(list(lrn_0, lrn_1,lrn_2, PipeOpNULL$new(id = &quot;NULL1&quot;))) # Cbind the output 3 times, train 2 learners but also keep level # 0 predictions level_1 = level_0 %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpFeatureUnion$new(4) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpCopy$new(3) %&gt;&gt;% gunion(list( PipeOpLearnerCV$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_cv_l1&quot;), PipeOpLearnerCV$new(glmn, id = &quot;glmnt_cv_l1&quot;), PipeOpNULL$new(id = &quot;NULL_l1&quot;) )) # Cbind predicitions, train a final learner. level_2 = level_1 %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpFeatureUnion$new(3, id = &quot;u2&quot;) %&gt;&gt;% PipeOpLearner$new(rprt, id = &quot;rpart_l2&quot;) # Plot the resulting graph level_2$plot(html = TRUE) %&gt;% visInteraction(zoomView = FALSE) # disable zoom task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;), lrn = GraphLearner$new(level_2) lrn$ train(task, train.idx)$ predict(task, test.idx)$ score() References "],
["pipe-special-ops.html", "5.6 Special Operators", " 5.6 Special Operators This section introduce some special operators, that might be useful in many applications. 5.6.1 Imputation: PipeOpImpute An often occurring setting is the imputation of missing data. Imputation methods range from relatively simple imputation using either mean, median or histograms to way more involved methods including using machine learning algorithms in order to predict missing values. The following PipeOp imputes numeric values from a histogram, adds a new level for factors and additionally adds a column marking whether a value for a given feature was missing or not. poi = PipeOpImpute$new(param_vals = list(method_num = &quot;hist&quot;, method_fct = &quot;sample&quot;, add_dummy = &quot;all&quot;)) A learner can thus be equipped with automatic imputation of missing values by adding an imputation Pipeop. polrn = PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)) lrn = GraphLearner$new(graph = poi %&gt;&gt;% polrn) 5.6.2 Feature Engineering: PipeOpMutate New features can be added or computed from a task using PipeOpMutate . The operator evaluates one or multiple expressions provided in an alist. In this example, we compute some new features on top of the iris task and add them to the data. pom = PipeOpMutate$new() # Define a set of mutations mutations = alist( Sepal.Sum = Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, Petal.Sum = Petal.Length + Petal.Width, Sepal.Petal.Ratio = (Sepal.Length / Petal.Length) ) pom$param_set$values$mutation = mutations If outside data is required, we can make use of the env parameter and additionally provide an environment, where expressions are evaluated (env defaults to .GlobalEnv). 5.6.3 Training on data subsets: PipeOpChunk In cases, where data is too big to fit into the machine’s memory, an often-used technique is to split the data into several parts, train on each part of the data and afterwards aggregate the models. In this example, we split our data into 4 parts using PipeOpChunk . Additionally, we create 4 PipeOpLearner POS, which are then trained on each split of the data. chks = PipeOpChunk$new(4) lrns = greplicate(PipeOpLearner$new(mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;)), 4) Afterwards we can use PipeOpMajorityVote to aggregate the predictions from the 4 different models into a new one. mjv = PipeOpMajorityVote$new(4) We can now connect the different operators and visualize the full graph: pipeline = chks %&gt;&gt;% lrns %&gt;&gt;% mjv pipeline$plot(html = TRUE) %&gt;% visInteraction(zoomView = FALSE) # disable zoom pipelrn = GraphLearner$new(pipeline) pipelrn$train(task, train.idx)$ predict(task, train.idx)$ score() #&gt; classif.ce #&gt; 0.4 5.6.4 Feature Selection: PipeOpFilter , PipeOpSelect mlr3filters contains many different Filters that can be used to select features for subsequent learners. This is often required when the data has a large amount of features. PipeOpFilter$new(mlr3filters::FilterInformationGain$new()) #&gt; PipeOp: &lt;information_gain&gt; (not trained) #&gt; values: &lt;list()&gt; #&gt; Input channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: #&gt; input [Task,Task] #&gt; Output channels &lt;name [train type, predict type]&gt;: #&gt; output [Task,Task] How many features to keep can be set using filter_nfeat, filter_frac and filter_cutoff. Filters can be selected / de-selected by name using PipeOpSelect . "],

At first, some details about parallelization and the usage of the future is given. Section Database Backends describes how to work with database backends that mlr3 supports. Database backends can be helpful for large data processing which does not fit in memory or is stored natively in a database (e.g. sqlite). In section Parameters instructions are given how to define parameter sets for learners, how do sample parameters and apply parameter transformations. Last, we provide a transition guide for users of the old mlr who want to switch to mlr3. "],
["parallelization.html", "6.1 Parallelization", " 6.1 Parallelization mlr3 uses the future backends for parallelization. Make sure you have installed the required packages future and future.apply: mlr3 is capable of parallelizing a variety of different scenarios. One of the most used cases is to parallelize the Resampling iterations. See Section Resampling for a detailed introduction to resampling. In the following, we will use the spam task and a simple classification tree (&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) to showcase parallelization. We use the future package to parallelize the resampling by selecting a backend via the function future::plan(). We use the &quot;multiprocess&quot; backend here which uses threads on UNIX based systems and a “Socket” cluster on Windows. future::plan(&quot;multiprocess&quot;) task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;spam&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) resampling = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;subsampling&quot;) time = Sys.time() resample(task, learner, resampling) Sys.time() - time By default all CPUs of your machine are used unless you specify argument workers in future::plan(). On most systems you should see a decrease in the reported elapsed time. On some systems (e.g. Windows), the overhead for parallelization is quite large though. Therefore, it is advised to only enable parallelization for resamplings where each iteration runs at least 10s. Choosing the parallelization level If you have are transitioning from mlr you might be used to selecting different parallelization levels, e.g. for resampling, benchmarking or tuning. In mlr3 this is no longer required All kind of events are rolled out on the same level - no need to decide whether you want to parallelize the tuning OR the resampling. Just lean back and let the machine do the work :-) "],
["error-handling.html", "6.2 Error Handling", " 6.2 Error Handling To demonstrate how to properly deal with misbehaving learners, mlr3 ships with the learner classif.debug: task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) print(learner) #&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifDebug:classif.debug&gt; #&gt; * Model: - #&gt; * Parameters: list() #&gt; * Packages: - #&gt; * Predict Type: response #&gt; * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, character, factor, ordered #&gt; * Properties: missings, multiclass, twoclass This learner comes with special hyperparameters that let us control what conditions should be signaled (message, warning, error, segfault) with what probability, during which stage the conditions should be signaled (train or predict), and the ratio of predictions being NA (predict_missing). learner$param_set #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: message_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 2: message_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 3: warning_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 4: warning_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 5: error_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 6: error_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 7: segfault_train ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 8: segfault_predict ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 9: predict_missing ParamDbl 0 1 0 #&gt; 10: save_tasks ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE FALSE #&gt; 11: x ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault&gt; With its default settings, the learner will do nothing special: it learns a random label and creates constant predictions. task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner$train(task)$predict(task)$confusion #&gt; truth #&gt; response setosa versicolor virginica #&gt; setosa 50 50 50 #&gt; versicolor 0 0 0 #&gt; virginica 0 0 0 We now set a hyperparameter to let the debug learner signal an error during the train step. By default,mlr3 does not catch conditions such as warnings or errors raised by third-party code like learners: learner$param_set$values = list(error_train = 1) learner$train(&quot;iris&quot;) #&gt; Error in learner$train_internal(task = task): Learner &#39;classif.debug&#39; on task &#39;iris&#39; failed to fit: Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() If this would be a regular learner, we could now start debugging with traceback() (or create a MRE to file a bug report). However, machine learning algorithms raising errors is not uncommon as algorithms typically cannot process all possible data. Thus, we need a mechanism to capture all signaled conditions such as messages, warnings and errors so that we can analyze them post-hoc, and a statistically sound way to proceed the calculation and be able to aggregate over partial results. These two mechanisms are explained in the following subsections. 6.2.1 Encapsulation With encapsulation, exceptions do not stop the program flow and all output is logged to the learner (instead of printed to the console). Each Learner has a field encapsulate to control how the train or predict steps are executed. One way to encapsulate the execution is provided by the package evaluate (see encapsulate() for more details): task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) learner$param_set$values = list(warning_train = 1, error_train = 1) learner$encapsulate = c(train = &quot;evaluate&quot;, predict = &quot;evaluate&quot;) learner$train(task) After training the learner, we can access the recorded log via the fields log, warnings and errors: learner$log #&gt; stage class #&gt; 1: train warning #&gt; 2: train error #&gt; msg #&gt; 1: Warning from classif.debug-&gt;train() #&gt; 2: Learner &#39;classif.debug&#39; on task &#39;iris&#39; failed to fit: Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() learner$warnings #&gt; [1] &quot;Warning from classif.debug-&gt;train()&quot; learner$errors #&gt; [1] &quot;Learner &#39;classif.debug&#39; on task &#39;iris&#39; failed to fit: Error from classif.debug-&gt;train()&quot; Another method for encapsulation is implemented in the callr package. callr spawns a new R process to execute the respective step, and thus even guards the current session from segfaults. On the downside, starting new processes comes with a computational overhead. learner$encapsulate = c(train = &quot;callr&quot;, predict = &quot;callr&quot;) learner$param_set$values = list(segfault_train = 1) learner$train(task = task) learner$errors #&gt; [1] &quot;callr process exited with status -11&quot; Without a model, it is not possible to get predictions though: learner$predict(task) #&gt; NULL To handle the missing predictions in a graceful way during resample() or benchmark(), fallback learners are introduced next. 6.2.2 Fallback learners Fallback learners have the purpose to allow scoring results in cases where a Learner is misbehaving in some sense. Some typical examples include: The learner fails to fit a model during training, e.g., if some convergence criterion is not met or the learner ran out of memory. The learner fails to predict for some or all observations. A typical case are new factor levels in the test data. We first handle the most common case that a learner completely breaks while fitting a model or while predicting on new data. If the learner fails in either of these two steps, we rely on a second learner to generate predictions: the fallback learner. In the next example, in addition to the debug learner, we attach a simple featureless learner to the debug learner. So whenever the debug learner fails (which is every time with the given parametrization) and encapsulation in enabled, mlr3 falls back to the predictions of the featureless learner internally: task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) learner$param_set$values = list(error_train = 1) learner$encapsulate = c(train = &quot;evaluate&quot;) learner$fallback = &quot;classif.featureless&quot; learner$train(task) learner #&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifDebug:classif.debug&gt; #&gt; * Model: - #&gt; * Parameters: error_train=1 #&gt; * Packages: - #&gt; * Predict Type: response #&gt; * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, character, factor, ordered #&gt; * Properties: missings, multiclass, twoclass #&gt; * Errors: Learner &#39;classif.debug&#39; on task &#39;iris&#39; failed to fit: Error #&gt; from classif.debug-&gt;train() Note that the log contains the captured error (which is also included in the print output), and although we don’t have a model, we can still get predictions: learner$model #&gt; NULL prediction = learner$predict(task) prediction$score() #&gt; classif.ce #&gt; 0.6667 While the fallback learner is of limited use for this stepwise train-predict procedure, it is invaluable for larger benchmark studies where only few resampling iterations are failing. Here, we need to replace the missing scores with a number in order to aggregate over all resampling iterations. And imputing a number which is equivalent to guessing labels often seems to be the right amount of penalization. In the following snippet we compare the previously created debug learner with a simple classification tree. We re-parametrize the debug learner to fail in roughly 30% of the resampling iterations during the training step: learner$param_set$values = list(error_train = 0.3) bmr = benchmark(expand_grid(&quot;iris&quot;, list(learner, &quot;classif.rpart&quot;), &quot;cv&quot;)) aggr = bmr$aggregate(errors = TRUE) aggr #&gt; hash resample_result task_id learner_id resampling_id errors #&gt; 1: 5745acb42cc42fe3 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; iris classif.debug cv 2 #&gt; 2: 437ecf23c42f3aa5 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; iris classif.rpart cv 0 #&gt; classif.ce #&gt; 1: 0.6933 #&gt; 2: 0.0600 To further investigate the errors, we can extract the ResampleResult: rr = aggr[learner_id == &quot;classif.debug&quot;]$resample_result[[1L]] rr$errors #&gt; iteration #&gt; 1: 4 #&gt; 2: 10 #&gt; msg #&gt; 1: Learner &#39;classif.debug&#39; on task &#39;iris&#39; failed to fit: Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() #&gt; 2: Learner &#39;classif.debug&#39; on task &#39;iris&#39; failed to fit: Error from classif.debug-&gt;train() A similar yet different problem emerges when a learner predicts only a subset of the observations in the test set (and predicts NA for others). Handling such predictions in a statistically sound way is not straight-forward and a common source for over-optimism when reporting results. Imagine that our goal is to benchmark two algorithms using a 10-fold cross validation on some binary classification task: Algorithm A is a ordinary logistic regression. Algorithm B is also a ordinary logistic regression, but with a twist: If the logistic regression is rather certain about the predicted label (&gt; 90% probability), it returns the label and a missing value otherwise. When comparing the performance of these two algorithms, it is obviously not fair to average over all predictions of algorithm A while only average over the “easy-to-predict” observations for algorithm B. By doing so, algorithm B would easily outperform algorithm A, but you have not factored in that you can not generate predictions for many observations. On the other hand, it is also not feasible to exclude all observations from the test set of a benchmark study where at least one algorithm failed to predict a label. Instead, we proceed by imputing all missing predictions with something naive, e.g., by predicting the majority class with a featureless learner. And as the majority class may depend on the resampling split (or we opt for some other arbitrary baseline learner), it is best to just train a second learner on the same resampling split. Long story short, if a fallback learner is involved, missing predictions of the base learner will be automatically replaced with predictions from the fallback learner. This is illustrated in the following example: task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.debug&quot;) # this hyperparameter sets the ratio of missing predictions learner$param_set$values = list(predict_missing = 0.5) # without fallback p = learner$train(task)$predict(task) table(p$response, useNA = &quot;always&quot;) #&gt; #&gt; setosa versicolor virginica &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 75 0 0 75 # with fallback learner$fallback = &quot;classif.featureless&quot; p = learner$train(task)$predict(task) table(p$response, useNA = &quot;always&quot;) #&gt; #&gt; setosa versicolor virginica &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; 75 75 0 0 Summed up, by combining encapsulation and fallback learners, it is possible to benchmark even quite unreliable or instable learning algorithms in a convenient way.

["backends.html", "6.3 Database Backends", " 6.3 Database Backends In mlr3, Tasks store their data in an abstract data format, the DataBackend.

["paradox.html", "6.4 Parameters (using paradox)", " 6.4 Parameters (using paradox) The paradox package offers a language for the description of parameter spaces, as well as tools for useful operations on these parameter spaces. A parameter space is often useful when describing a set of sensible input values for an R function, the set of possible values that slots of a configuration object can take, or the search space of an optimization process. The tools provided by paradox therefore relate to - Parameter checking: Verifying that a set of parameters satisfies the conditions of a parameter space and - Parameter sampling: Generating parameter values that lie in the parameter space for systematic exploration of program behavior depending on these parameters. paradox is, by its nature, an auxiliary package that derives its usefulness from other packages that make use of it. It is heavily utilized in other mlr-org packages such as mlr3, mlr3pipelines, and mlr3tuning. 6.4.1 Reference Based Objects paradox is the spiritual successor to the ParamHelpers package and was written from scratch using the R6 class system. The most important consequence of this is that all objects created in paradox are “reference-based”, unlike most other objects in R. When a change is made to a ParamSet object, for example by adding a parameter using the $add() function, all variables that point to this ParamSet will contain the changed object. To create an independent copy of a ParamSet, the $clone() method needs to be used: library(&quot;paradox&quot;) ps = ParamSet$new() ps2 = ps ps3 = ps$clone(deep = TRUE) print(ps) # the same for ps2 and ps3 #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; Empty. ps$add(ParamLgl$new(&quot;a&quot;)) print(ps) # ps was changed #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: a ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault&gt; print(ps2) # contains the same reference as ps #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: a ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault&gt; print(ps3) # is a &quot;clone&quot; of the old (empty) ps #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; Empty. 6.4.2 Defining a Parameter Space 6.4.2.1 Single Parameters The basic building block for describing parameter spaces is the Param class. It represents a single parameter, which usually can take a single atomic value. Consider, for example, trying to configure the rpart package’s rpart.control object. It has various components (minsplit, cp, …) that all take a single value, and that would all be represented by a different instance of a Param object. The Param class has various subclasses that represent different value types: ParamInt: Integer numbers ParamDbl: Real numbers ParamFct: String values from a set of possible values, similar to R factors ParamLgl: Truth values (TRUE / FALSE), as logicals in R ParamUty: Parameter that can take any value A particular instance of a parameter is created by calling the attached $new() function: library(&quot;paradox&quot;) parA = ParamLgl$new(id = &quot;A&quot;) parB = ParamInt$new(id = &quot;B&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 10, tags = c(&quot;tag1&quot;, &quot;tag2&quot;)) parC = ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;C&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 4, special_vals = list(NULL)) parD = ParamFct$new(id = &quot;D&quot;, levels = c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;), default = &quot;y&quot;) parE = ParamUty$new(id = &quot;E&quot;, custom_check = function(x) checkmate::checkFunction(x)) Every parameter must have an id—its name within the parameter set—, and may also have a default value (default), a list of values that are accepted even if they do not conform to the type (special_vals). tags that can be used to organize parameters. The numeric (Int and Dbl) parameters furthermore allow for specification of a lower and upper bound, while the Fct parameter must be given a vector of levels that define the possible states its parameter can take. The Uty parameter can also have a custom_check function that must return TRUE when a value is acceptable and may return a character(1) error description otherwise. The example above defines parE as a parameter that only accepts functions. All values which are given to the constructor are then accessible from the object for inspection using $. Although all these values can be changed for a parameter after construction, this can be a bad idea and should be avoided when possible. Instead, a new parameter should be constructed. Besides the possible values that can be given to a constructor, there are also the $class, $nlevels, $is_bounded, $has_default, $storage_type, $is_number and $is_categ slots that give information about a parameter. A list of all slots can be found in ?Param. parB$lower #&gt; [1] 0 parA$levels #&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE parE$class #&gt; [1] &quot;ParamUty&quot; It is also possible to get all information of a Param as data.table by calling as.data.table. as.data.table(parA) #&gt; id class lower upper levels nlevels is_bounded special_vals default storage_type tags #&gt; 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE 2 TRUE &lt;list&gt; &lt;NoDefault&gt; logical 6.4.2.1.1 Type / Range Checking A Param object offers the possibility to check whether a value satisfies its condition, i.e. is of the right type, and also falls within the range of allowed values, using the $test(), $check(), and $assert() functions. test() should be used within conditional checks and returns TRUE or FALSE, while check() returns an error description when a value does not conform to the parameter (and thus plays well with the checkmate::assert() function). assert() will throw an error whenever a value does not fit. parA$test(FALSE) #&gt; [1] TRUE parA$test(&quot;FALSE&quot;) #&gt; [1] FALSE parA$check(&quot;FALSE&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;Must be of type &#39;logical flag&#39;, not &#39;character&#39;&quot; Instead of testing single parameters, it is often more convenient to check a whole set of parameters using a ParamSet. 6.4.2.2 Parameter Sets The ordered collection of parameters is handled in a ParamSet1. It is initialized using the $new() function and optionally takes a list of Params as argument. Parameters can also be added to the constructed ParamSet using the $add() function. It is even possible to add whole ParamSets to other ParamSets. ps = ParamSet$new(list(parA, parB)) ps$add(parC) ps$add(ParamSet$new(list(parD, parE))) print(ps) #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 2: B ParamInt 0 10 &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 4: D ParamFct NA NA x,y,z y #&gt; 5: E ParamUty NA NA &lt;NoDefault&gt; The individual parameters can be accessed through the $params slot. It is also possible to get information about all parameters in a vectorized fashion using mostly the same slots as for individual Params (i.e. $class, $levels etc.), see ?ParamSet for details. It is possible to reduce ParamSets using the $subset method. Be aware that it modifies a ParamSet in-place, so a “clone” must be created first if the original ParamSet should not be modified. psSmall = ps$clone() psSmall$subset(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)) print(psSmall) #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 2: B ParamInt 0 10 &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 &lt;NoDefault&gt; Just as for Params, and much more useful, it is possible to get the ParamSet as a data.table using as.data.table(). This makes it easy to subset parameters on certain conditions and aggregate information about them, using the variety of methods provided by data.table. as.data.table(ps) #&gt; id class lower upper levels nlevels is_bounded special_vals default storage_type tags #&gt; 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE 2 TRUE &lt;list&gt; &lt;NoDefault&gt; logical #&gt; 2: B ParamInt 0 10 11 TRUE &lt;list&gt; &lt;NoDefault&gt; integer tag1,tag2 #&gt; 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 Inf TRUE &lt;list&gt; &lt;NoDefault&gt; numeric #&gt; 4: D ParamFct NA NA x,y,z 3 TRUE &lt;list&gt; y character #&gt; 5: E ParamUty NA NA Inf FALSE &lt;list&gt; &lt;NoDefault&gt; list 6.4.2.2.1 Type / Range Checking Similar to individual Params, the ParamSet provides $test(), $check() and $assert() functions that allow for type and range checking of parameters. Their argument must be a named list with values that are checked against the respective parameters. It is possible to check only a subset of parameters. ps$check(list(A = TRUE, B = 0, E = identity)) #&gt; [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = 1)) #&gt; [1] &quot;A: Must be of type &#39;logical flag&#39;, not &#39;double&#39;&quot; ps$check(list(Z = 1)) #&gt; [1] &quot;Parameter &#39;Z&#39; not available. Did you mean &#39;A&#39; / &#39;B&#39; / &#39;C&#39;?&quot; 6.4.2.2.2 Values in a ParamSet Although a ParamSet fundamentally represents a value space, it also has a slot $values that can contain a point within that space. This is useful because many things that define a parameter space need similar operations (like parameter checking) that can be simplified. The $values slot contains a named list that is always checked against parameter constraints. When trying to set parameter values, e.g. for mlr3 Learners, it is the $values slot of its $param_set that needs to be used. ps$values = list(A = TRUE, B = 0) ps$values$B = 1 print(ps$values) #&gt; $A #&gt; [1] TRUE #&gt; #&gt; $B #&gt; [1] 1 The parameter constraints are automatically checked: ps$values$B = 100 #&gt; Error in (function (xs) : Assertion on &#39;xs&#39; failed: B: Element 1 is not &lt;= 10. 6.4.2.2.3 Dependencies It is often the case that certain parameters are irrelevant or should not be given depending on values of other parameters. An example would be a parameter that switches a certain algorithm feature (for example regularization) on or off, combined with another parameter that controls the behavior of that feature (e.g. a regularization parameter). The second parameter would be said to depend on the first parameter having the value TRUE. A dependency can be added using the $add_dep method, which takes both the ids of the “depender” and “dependee” parameters as well as a Condition object. The Condition object represents the check to be performed on the “dependee”. Currently it can be created using CondEqual$new() and CondAnyOf$new(). Multiple dependencies can be added, and parameters that depend on others can again be depended on, as long as no cyclic dependencies are introduced. The consequence of dependencies are twofold: For one, the $check(), $test() and $assert() tests will not accept the presence of a parameter if its dependency is not met. Furthermore, when sampling or creating grid designs from a ParamSet, the dependencies will be respected (see Parameter Sampling, in particular Hierarchical Sampler). The following example makes parameter D depend on parameter A being FALSE, and parameter B depend on parameter D being one of &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot;. This introduces an implicit dependency of B on A being FALSE as well, because D does not take any value if A is TRUE. ps$add_dep(&quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, CondEqual$new(FALSE)) ps$add_dep(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, CondAnyOf$new(c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;))) ps$check(list(A = FALSE, D = &quot;x&quot;, B = 1)) # OK: all dependencies met #&gt; [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = FALSE, D = &quot;z&quot;, B = 1)) # B&#39;s dependency is not met #&gt; [1] &quot;Condition for &#39;B&#39; not ok: D anyof x, y; instead: D=z&quot; ps$check(list(A = FALSE, B = 1)) # B&#39;s dependency is not met #&gt; [1] &quot;Condition for &#39;B&#39; not ok: D anyof x, y; instead: D=&lt;not-there&gt;&quot; ps$check(list(A = FALSE, D = &quot;z&quot;)) # OK: B is absent #&gt; [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = TRUE)) # OK: neither B nor D present #&gt; [1] TRUE ps$check(list(A = TRUE, D = &quot;x&quot;, B = 1)) # D&#39;s dependency is not met #&gt; [1] &quot;Condition for &#39;D&#39; not ok: A equal FALSE; instead: A=TRUE&quot; ps$check(list(A = TRUE, B = 1)) # B&#39;s dependency is not met #&gt; [1] &quot;Condition for &#39;B&#39; not ok: D anyof x, y; instead: D=&lt;not-there&gt;&quot; Internally, the dependencies are represented as a data.table, which can be accessed listed in the $deps slot. This data.table can even be mutated, for example to remove dependencies. There are no sanity checks done when the $deps slot is changed this way, so be careful. ps$deps #&gt; id on cond #&gt; 1: D A &lt;CondEqual&gt; #&gt; 2: B D &lt;CondAnyOf&gt; 6.4.2.3 Vector Parameters Unlike in the old ParamHelpers package, there are no more vectorial parameters in paradox. Instead, it is now possible to create multiple copies of a single parameter using the $rep function. This creates a ParamSet consisting of multiple copies of the parameter, which can then (optionally) be added to another ParamSet. ps2d = ParamDbl$new(&quot;x&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 1)$rep(2) print(ps2d) #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: x_rep_1 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 2: x_rep_2 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault&gt; ps$add(ps2d) print(ps) #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default parents value #&gt; 1: A ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE &lt;NoDefault&gt; TRUE #&gt; 2: B ParamInt 0 10 &lt;NoDefault&gt; D 1 #&gt; 3: C ParamDbl 0 4 &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 4: D ParamFct NA NA x,y,z y A #&gt; 5: E ParamUty NA NA &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 6: x_rep_1 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault&gt; #&gt; 7: x_rep_2 ParamDbl 0 1 &lt;NoDefault&gt; It is also possible to use a ParamUty to accept vectorial parameters, which also works for parameters of variable length. A ParamSet containing a ParamUty can be used for parameter checking, but not for sampling. To sample values for a method that needs a vectorial parameter, it is advised to use a parameter transformation function that creates a vector from atomic values. Assembling a vector from repeated parameters is aided by the parameter’s $tags: Parameters that were generated by the $rep() command automatically get tagged as belonging to a group of repeated parameters: ps$tags #&gt; $A #&gt; character(0) #&gt; #&gt; $B #&gt; [1] &quot;tag1&quot; &quot;tag2&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $C #&gt; character(0) #&gt; #&gt; $D #&gt; character(0) #&gt; #&gt; $E #&gt; character(0) #&gt; #&gt; $x_rep_1 #&gt; [1] &quot;x_rep&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $x_rep_2 #&gt; [1] &quot;x_rep&quot; 6.4.3 Parameter Sampling It is often useful to have a list of possible parameter values that can be systematically iterated through, for example to find parameter values for which an algorithm performs particularly well (tuning). paradox offers a variety of functions that allow creating evenly-spaced parameter values in a “grid” design as well as random sampling. In the latter case, it is possible to influence the sampling distribution in more or less fine detail. A point to always keep in mind while sampling is that only numerical and factorial parameters that are bounded can be sampled from, i.e. not ParamUty. Furthermore, for most samplers ParamInt and ParamDbl must have finite lower and upper bounds. 6.4.3.1 Parameter Designs Functions that sample the parameter space fundamentally return an object of the Design class. These objects contain the sampled data as a data.table under the $data slot, and also offer conversion to a list of parameter-values using the $transpose() function. 6.4.3.2 Grid Design The generate_design_grid() function is used to create grid designs that contain all combinations of parameter values: All possible values for ParamLgl and ParamFct, and values with a given resolution for ParamInt and ParamDbl. The resolution can be given for all numeric parameters, or for specific named parameters through the param_resolutions parameter. design = generate_design_grid(psSmall, 2) print(design) #&gt; &lt;Design&gt; with 8 rows: #&gt; A B C #&gt; 1: TRUE 0 0 #&gt; 2: TRUE 0 4 #&gt; 3: TRUE 10 0 #&gt; 4: TRUE 10 4 #&gt; 5: FALSE 0 0 #&gt; 6: FALSE 0 4 #&gt; 7: FALSE 10 0 #&gt; 8: FALSE 10 4 generate_design_grid(psSmall, param_resolutions = c(B = 1, C = 2)) #&gt; &lt;Design&gt; with 4 rows: #&gt; B C A #&gt; 1: 0 0 TRUE #&gt; 2: 0 0 FALSE #&gt; 3: 0 4 TRUE #&gt; 4: 0 4 FALSE 6.4.3.3 Random Sampling paradox offers different methods for random sampling, which vary in the degree to which they can be configured. The easiest way to get a uniformly random sample of parameters is generate_design_random. It is also possible to create “latin hypercube” sampled parameter values using generate_design_lhs, which utilizes the lhs package. LHS-sampling creates low-discrepancy sampled values that cover the parameter space more evenly than purely random values. pvrand = generate_design_random(ps2d, 500) pvlhs = generate_design_lhs(ps2d, 500) 6.4.3.4 Generalized Sampling: The Sampler Class It may sometimes be desirable to configure parameter sampling in more detail. paradox uses the Sampler abstract base class for sampling, which has many different subclasses that can be parameterized and combined to control the sampling process. It is even possible to create further subclasses of the Sampler class (or of any of its subclasses) for even more possibilities. Every Sampler object has a sample() function, which takes one argument, the number of instances to sample, and returns a Design object. 6.4.3.4.1 1D-Samplers There is a variety of samplers that sample values for a single parameter. These are Sampler1DUnif (uniform sampling), Sampler1DCateg (sampling for categorical parameters), Sampler1DNormal (normally distributed sampling, truncated at parameter bounds), and Sampler1DRfun (arbitrary 1D sampling, given a random-function). These are initialized with a single Param, and can then be used to sample values. sampA = Sampler1DCateg$new(parA) sampA$sample(5) #&gt; &lt;Design&gt; with 5 rows: #&gt; A #&gt; 1: FALSE #&gt; 2: TRUE #&gt; 3: TRUE #&gt; 4: FALSE #&gt; 5: TRUE 6.4.3.4.2 Hierarchical Sampler The SamplerHierarchical sampler is an auxiliary sampler that combines many 1D-Samplers to get a combined distribution. Its name “hierarchical” implies that it is able to respect parameter dependencies: Parameters only get sampled when their dependencies are met. The following example shows how this works: The Int parameter B depends on the Lgl parameter A being TRUE. A is sampled to be TRUE in about half the cases, in which case B takes a value between 0 and 10. In the cases where A is FALSE, B is set to NA. psSmall$add_dep(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, CondEqual$new(TRUE)) sampH = SamplerHierarchical$new(psSmall, list(Sampler1DCateg$new(parA), Sampler1DUnif$new(parB), Sampler1DUnif$new(parC)) ) sampled = sampH$sample(1000) table(sampled$data[, c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;)], useNA = &quot;ifany&quot;) #&gt; B #&gt; A 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 &lt;NA&gt; #&gt; FALSE 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 488 #&gt; TRUE 48 43 54 47 57 38 41 50 45 40 49 0 6.4.3.4.3 Joint Sampler Another way of combining samplers is the SamplerJointIndep. It also makes it possible to combine Samplers that are not 1D. However, it currently can not handle ParamSets with dependencies. sampJ = SamplerJointIndep$new( list(Sampler1DUnif$new(ParamDbl$new(&quot;x&quot;, 0, 1)), Sampler1DUnif$new(ParamDbl$new(&quot;y&quot;, 0, 1))) ) sampJ$sample(5) #&gt; &lt;Design&gt; with 5 rows: #&gt; x y #&gt; 1: 0.3691 0.2442 #&gt; 2: 0.9093 0.4359 #&gt; 3: 0.1523 0.3704 #&gt; 4: 0.4946 0.6149 #&gt; 5: 0.8063 0.4561 6.4.3.4.4 SamplerUnif The Sampler used in generate_design_random is the SamplerUnif sampler, which corresponds to a HierarchicalSampler of Sampler1DUnif for all parameters. 6.4.4 Parameter Transformation While the different Samplers allow for a wide specification of parameter distributions, there are cases where the simplest way of getting a desired distribution is to sample parameters from a simple distribution (such as the uniform distribution) and then transform them. This can be done by assigning a function to the $trafo slot of a ParamSet. The $trafo function is called with two parameters: The list of parameter values to be transformed as x, and the ParamSet itself as param_set; it must return a list of transformed parameter values. The transformation is performed when calling the $transpose function of the Design object returned by a Sampler with the trafo ParamSet to TRUE (the default). The following, for example, creates a parameter that is exponentially distributed: psexp = ParamSet$new(list(ParamDbl$new(&quot;par&quot;, 0, 1))) psexp$trafo = function(x, param_set) { x$par = -log(x$par) x } design = generate_design_random(psexp, 2) print(design) #&gt; &lt;Design&gt; with 2 rows: #&gt; par #&gt; 1: 0.38790 #&gt; 2: 0.04812 design$transpose() # trafo is TRUE #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [[1]]$par #&gt; [1] 0.947 #&gt; #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; [[2]]$par #&gt; [1] 3.034 Compare this to $transpose() without transformation: design$transpose(trafo = FALSE) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [[1]]$par #&gt; [1] 0.3879 #&gt; #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; [[2]]$par #&gt; [1] 0.04812 6.4.4.1 Transformation between Types Usually the design created with one ParamSet is then used to configure other objects that themselves have a ParamSet which defines the values they take. The ParamSets which can be used for random sampling, however, are restricted in some ways: They must have finite bounds, and they may not contain “untyped” (ParamUty) parameters. $trafo provides the glue for these situations. There is relatively little constraint on the trafo function’s return value, so it is possible to return values that have different bounds or even types than the original ParamSet. It is even possible to remove some parameters and add new ones. Suppose, for example, that a certain method requires a function as a parameter, Let’s say a function that summarizes its data in a certain way. The user can pass functions like median() or mean(), but could also pass quantiles or something completely different. This method would probably use the following ParamSet: methodPS = ParamSet$new( list( ParamUty$new(&quot;fun&quot;, custom_check = function(x) checkmate::checkFunction(x, nargs = 1)) ) ) print(methodPS) #&gt; ParamSet: #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: fun ParamUty NA NA &lt;NoDefault&gt; If one wanted to sample this method, using one of four functions, a way to do this would be samplingPS = ParamSet$new( list( ParamFct$new(&quot;fun&quot;, c(&quot;mean&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, &quot;max&quot;)) ) ) samplingPS$trafo = function(x, param_set) { # x$fun is a `character(1)`, # in particular one of &#39;mean&#39;, &#39;median&#39;, &#39;min&#39;, &#39;max&#39;. # We want to turn it into a function! x$fun = get(x$fun, mode = &quot;function&quot;) x } design = generate_design_random(samplingPS, 2) print(design) #&gt; &lt;Design&gt; with 2 rows: #&gt; fun #&gt; 1: mean #&gt; 2: mean Note that the Design only contains the column “fun” as a character column. To get a single value as a function, the $transpose function is used. xvals = design$transpose() print(xvals[[1]]) #&gt; $fun #&gt; function (x, ...) #&gt; UseMethod(&quot;mean&quot;) #&gt; &lt;bytecode: 0x455c560&gt; #&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; We can now check that it fits the requirements set by methodPS, and that fun it is in fact a function: methodPS$check(xvals[[1]]) #&gt; [1] TRUE xvals[[1]]$fun(1:10) #&gt; [1] 5.5 Imagine now that a different kind of parametrization of the function is desired: The user wants to give a function that selects a certain quantile, where the quantile is set by a parameter. In that case the $transpose function could generate a function in a different way. For interpretability, the parameter is called “quantile” before transformation, and the “fun” parameter is generated on the fly. samplingPS2 = ParamSet$new( list( ParamDbl$new(&quot;quantile&quot;, 0, 1) ) ) samplingPS2$trafo = function(x, param_set) { # x$quantile is a `numeric(1)` between 0 and 1. # We want to turn it into a function! list(fun = function(input) quantile(input, x$quantile)) } design = generate_design_random(samplingPS2, 2) print(design) #&gt; &lt;Design&gt; with 2 rows: #&gt; quantile #&gt; 1: 0.8080 #&gt; 2: 0.7724 The Design now contains the column “quantile” that will be used by the $transpose function to create the fun parameter.

Because lgr comes with its own exhaustive vignette, we will just briefly give examples how you can change the most important settings related to logging in mlr3. 6.5.1 Available logging levels lgr comes with certain numeric thresholds which correspond to verbosity levels of the logging. For mlr3 the default is set to 400 which corresponds to level “info”. The following ones are available: library(&quot;lgr&quot;) getOption(&quot;lgr.log_levels&quot;) #&gt; fatal error warn info debug trace #&gt; 100 200 300 400 500 600 6.5.2 Global Setting lgr comes with a global option called &quot;lgr.default_threshold&quot; which can be set via options(). You can set a specific level in your .Rprofile which is then used for all packages that use the lgr package. This approach may not be desirable if you want to only change the logging level for mlr3. 6.5.3 Changing mlr3 logging levels To change the setting for mlr3 only, you need to change the threshold of the mlr3 logger like this: lgr::get_logger(&quot;mlr3&quot;)$set_threshold(&quot;&lt;level&gt;&quot;)` Remember that this change only applies to the current R session. You can check the new setting by calling mlr_control(). "],

["extending-mlr3.html", "7.1 Extending mlr3", " 7.1 Extending mlr3 7.1.1 Learners Here, we show how to create a custom LearnerClassif step-by-step. Preferably, you start by copying over code from an existing Learner, e.g. from the &quot;classif.rpart learner on GitHub. Alternatively, here is a template for a new classification learner: LearnerClassifYourLearner = R6::R6Class(&quot;LearnerClassifYourLearner&quot;, inherit = LearnerClassif, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;classif.yourlearner&quot;) { super$initialize( id = id, param_set = ParamSet$new(), param_vals = list() predict_types = , feature_types = , properties = , packages = , ) }, train = function(task) { }, predict = function(task) { } ) ) In the first line of the template, we create a new R6 class with class &quot;LearnerClassifYourLearner&quot;. The next line determines the parent class: As we want to create a classification learner, we obviously want to inherit from LearnerClassif. A learner consists of three parts: Meta information about the learners A train_internal() function which takes a (filtered) TaskClassif and returns a model A predict_internal() function which operates on the model in self$model (stored during $train()) and a (differently subsetted) TaskClassif to return a named list of predictions. 7.1.1.1 Meta-information In the constructor function initialize() the constructor of the super class LearnerClassif is called with meta information about the leaner we want to construct. This includes: id: The id of the new learner. param_set: A set of hyperparameters and their description, provided as paradox::ParamSet. param_vals: Default hyperparameter settings as named list. predict_types: Set of predict types the learner is capable of. For classification, this must be a subset of “response”, “c(”response“,”prob“)”. See mlr_reflection$learner_predict_types for possible predict types of other tasks. feature_types: Set of feature types the learner can handle. See mlr_reflections$task_feature_types for feature types supported by mlr3. properties: Set of properties of the learner. Possible properties include: &quot;twoclass&quot;: The learner works on binary classification problems. &quot;multiclass&quot;: The learner works on multi-class classification problems. &quot;missings&quot;: The learner can natively handle missing values. &quot;weights&quot;: The learner can work on tasks which have observation weights / case weights. &quot;parallel&quot;: The learner can be parallelized, e.g. via threading. &quot;importance&quot;: The learner supports extracting importance values for features. If this property is set, you must also implement a public method importance() to retrieve the importance values from the model. &quot;selected features&quot;: The learner supports extracting the features which where used. If this property is set, you must also implement a public method selected_features() to retrieve the set of used features from the model. Set of required packages to run the learner. For a simplified rpart::rpart(), the initialization could look like this: initialize = function(id = &quot;classif.rpart&quot;) { super$initialize( id = id, packages = &quot;rpart&quot;, feature_types = c(&quot;logical&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;numeric&quot;, &quot;factor&quot;), predict_types = c(&quot;response&quot;, &quot;prob&quot;), param_set = ParamSet$new( params = list( ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;cp&quot;, default = 0.01, lower = 0, upper = 1, tags = &quot;train&quot;), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;xval&quot;, default = 0L, lower = 0L, tags = &quot;train&quot;) ) ), param_vals = list(xval = 0L), properties = c(&quot;twoclass&quot;, &quot;multiclass&quot;, &quot;weights&quot;, &quot;missings&quot;) ) } We only have specified a small subset of the available hyperparameters: The complexity &quot;cp&quot; is numeric, its feasible range is [0,1], it defaults to 0.01 and the parameter is used during &quot;train&quot;. The complexity &quot;xval&quot; is integer, its lower bound 0, its default is 0 and the parameter is also used during &quot;train&quot;. Note that we have changed the default here from 10 to 0 to save some computation time. This is not done by setting a different default in ParamInt$new(), but instead by setting the value implicitly via param_vals. 7.1.1.2 Train function We continue the to adept the template for a rpart::rpart() learner, and now tackle the train_internal() function. The train function takes a Task as input and must return an arbitrary model. First, we write something down that works completely without mlr3: data = iris model = rpart::rpart(Species ~ ., data = iris, xval = 0) In the next step, we replace the data frame data with a Task: task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) model = rpart::rpart(Species ~ ., data = task$data(), xval = 0) The target variable &quot;Species&quot; is still hard-coded and specific to the task. This is unnecessary, as the information about the target variable is stored in the task: task$target_names #&gt; [1] &quot;Species&quot; task$formula() #&gt; Species ~ . #&gt; NULL We can adapt our code accordingly: rpart::rpart(task$formula(), data = task$data(), xval = 0) #&gt; n= 150 #&gt; #&gt; node), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob) #&gt; * denotes terminal node #&gt; #&gt; 1) root 150 100 setosa (0.33333 0.33333 0.33333) #&gt; 2) Petal.Length&lt; 2.45 50 0 setosa (1.00000 0.00000 0.00000) * #&gt; 3) Petal.Length&gt;=2.45 100 50 versicolor (0.00000 0.50000 0.50000) #&gt; 6) Petal.Width&lt; 1.75 54 5 versicolor (0.00000 0.90741 0.09259) * #&gt; 7) Petal.Width&gt;=1.75 46 1 virginica (0.00000 0.02174 0.97826) * The last thing missing is the handling of hyperparameters. Instead of the hard-coded xval, we query the hyperparameter settings from the Learner itself. To illustrate this, we quickly construct the tree learner from the mlr3 package, and use the method get_value() from the ParamSet to retrieve all set hyperparameters with tag &quot;train&quot;. self = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.rpart&quot;) self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;train&quot;) #&gt; $xval #&gt; [1] 0 To pass all hyperparameters down to the model fitting function, we recommend to use either do.call or the function mlr3misc::invoke(). pars = self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;train&quot;) mlr3misc::invoke(rpart::rpart, task$formula(), data = task$data(), .args = pars) #&gt; n= 150 #&gt; #&gt; node), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob) #&gt; * denotes terminal node #&gt; #&gt; 1) root 150 100 setosa (0.33333 0.33333 0.33333) #&gt; 2) Petal.Length&lt; 2.45 50 0 setosa (1.00000 0.00000 0.00000) * #&gt; 3) Petal.Length&gt;=2.45 100 50 versicolor (0.00000 0.50000 0.50000) #&gt; 6) Petal.Width&lt; 1.75 54 5 versicolor (0.00000 0.90741 0.09259) * #&gt; 7) Petal.Width&gt;=1.75 46 1 virginica (0.00000 0.02174 0.97826) * In the final learner, self will of course reference the learner itself. In the last step, we wrap everything in a function. train_internal = function(task) { pars = self$param_set$get_values(tags = &quot;train&quot;) mlr3misc::invoke(rpart::rpart, task$formula(), data = task$data(), .args = pars) } 7.1.1.3 Predict function The internal predict function predict_internal also operates on a Task as well as on the model stored during train() in self$model. The return value is a Prediction object. We proceed analogously to the section on the train function: We start with a version without any mlr3 objects and continue to replace objects until we have reached the desired interface: # inputs: task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) self = list(model = rpart::rpart(task$formula(), data = task$data())) data = iris response = predict(self$model, newdata = data, type = &quot;class&quot;) prob = predict(self$model, newdata = data, type = &quot;prob&quot;) The rpart::predict.rpart() function predicts class labels if argument type is set to to &quot;class&quot;, and class probabilities if set to &quot;prob&quot;. Next, we transition from data to a task again and construct a proper PredictionClassif object to return. Additionally, as we do not want to run the prediction twice, we differentiate what type of prediction is requested by querying the set predict type of the learner. The complete predict_internal function looks like this: predict_internal = function(task) { self$predict_type = &quot;response&quot; response = prob = NULL if (self$predict_type == &quot;response&quot;) { response = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = &quot;class&quot;) } else { prob = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = &quot;prob&quot;) } PredictionClassif$new(task, response = response, prob = prob) } Note that if the learner would need to handle hyperparameters during the predict step, we would proceed analogously to the train() step and use self$params(&quot;predict&quot;) in combination with mlr3misc::invoke(). 7.1.1.4 Final learner LearnerClassifYourRpart = R6::R6Class(&quot;LearnerClassifYourRpart&quot;, inherit = LearnerClassif, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;classif.rpart&quot;) { super$initialize( id = id, packages = &quot;rpart&quot;, feature_types = c(&quot;logical&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;numeric&quot;, &quot;factor&quot;), predict_types = c(&quot;response&quot;, &quot;prob&quot;), param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new( params = list( paradox::ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;cp&quot;, default = 0.01, lower = 0, upper = 1, tags = &quot;train&quot;), paradox::ParamInt$new(id = &quot;xval&quot;, default = 0L, lower = 0L, tags = &quot;train&quot;) ) ), param_vals = list(xval = 0L), properties = c(&quot;twoclass&quot;, &quot;multiclass&quot;, &quot;weights&quot;, &quot;missings&quot;) ) }, train_internal = function(task) { pars = self$param_set$get_values(tag = &quot;train&quot;) mlr3misc::invoke(rpart::rpart, task$formula(), data = task$data(), .args = pars) }, predict_internal = function(task) { self$predict_type = &quot;response&quot; response = prob = NULL if (self$predict_type == &quot;response&quot;) { response = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = &quot;class&quot;) } else { prob = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = &quot;prob&quot;) } PredictionClassif$new(task, response = response, prob = prob) } ) ) lrn = LearnerClassifYourRpart$new() print(lrn) #&gt; &lt;LearnerClassifYourRpart:classif.rpart&gt; #&gt; * Model: - #&gt; * Parameters: xval=0 #&gt; * Packages: rpart #&gt; * Predict Type: response #&gt; * Feature types: logical, integer, numeric, factor #&gt; * Properties: missings, multiclass, twoclass, weights To run some basic tests: task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;iris&quot;) lrn$train(task) p = lrn$predict(task) p$confusion #&gt; truth #&gt; response setosa versicolor virginica #&gt; setosa 50 0 0 #&gt; versicolor 0 49 5 #&gt; virginica 0 1 45 To run a bunch of automatic tests, you may source some auxiliary scripts from the unit tests of mlr3: helper = list.files(system.file(&quot;testthat&quot;, package = &quot;mlr3&quot;), pattern = &quot;^helper.*\\\\.[rR]&quot;, full.names = TRUE) ok = lapply(helper, source) stopifnot(run_autotest(lrn)) "],

When planning to create custom PipeOp objects, it can only help to familiarize yourself with it. In principle, all a PipeOp must do is inherit from the PipeOp R6 class and implement the train() and test() functions. There are, however, several auxiliary subclasses that can make the creation of certain operations much easier. 7.2.1 General Case Example: PipeOpCopy A very simple yet useful PipeOp is PipeOpCopy, which takes a single input and creates a variable number of output channels, all of which receive a copy of the input data. It is a simple example that showcases the important steps in defining a custom PipeOp. We will show a simplified version here, PipeOpCopyTwo, that creates exactly two copies of its input data. The following figure visualizes how our PipeOp is situated in the Pipeline and the significant in- and outputs. Pipeop Copy2 7.2.1.1 First Steps: Inheriting from PipeOp The first part of creating a custom PipeOp is inheriting from PipeOp. We make a mental note that we need to implement a train() and a predict() function, and that we probably want to have an initialize() as well: PipeOpCopyTwo = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpCopyTwo&quot;, inherit = PipeOp, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;copy.two&quot;) { .... }, train = function(inputs) { .... }, predict = function(inputs) { .... } ) ) 7.2.1.2 Channel Definitions We need to tell the PipeOp the layout of its channels: How many there are, what their names are going to be, and what types are acceptable. This is done on initialization of the PipeOp (using a super$initialize call) by giving the input and output data.table objects. These must have three columns: a &quot;name&quot; column giving the names of input and output channels, and a &quot;train&quot; and &quot;predict&quot; column naming the class of objects we expect during training and prediction as input / output. A special value for these classes is &quot;*&quot;, which indicates that any class will be accepted; our simple copy operator accepts any kind of input, so this will be useful. We have only one input, but two output channels. By convention, we name a single channel &quot;input&quot; or &quot;output&quot;, and a group of channels [&quot;input1&quot;, &quot;input2&quot;, …], unless there is a reason to give specific different names. Therefore, our input data.table will have a single row &lt;&quot;input&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;&gt;, and our output table will have two rows, &lt;&quot;output1&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;&gt; and &lt;&quot;output2&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*&quot;&gt;. All of this is given to the PipeOp creator. Our initialize() will thus look as follows: initialize = function(id = &quot;copy.two&quot;) { input = data.table::data.table(name = &quot;input&quot;, train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot;) # the following will create two rows and automatically fill the `train` # and `predict` cols with &quot;*&quot; output = data.table::data.table( name = c(&quot;output1&quot;, &quot;output2&quot;), train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot; ) super$initialize(id, input = input, output = output ) } 7.2.1.3 Train and Predict Both train() and predict() will receive a list as input and must give a list in return. According to our input and output definitions, we will always get a list with a single element as input, and will need to return a list with two elements. Because all we want to do is create two copies, we will just create the copies using c(inputs, inputs). Two things to consider: The train() function must always modify the self$state variable to something that is not NULL or NO_OP. This is because the $state slot is used as a signal that PipeOp has been trained on data, even if the state itself is not important to the PipeOp (as in our case). Therefore, our train() will set self$state = list(). It is not necessary to “clone” our input or make deep copies, because we don’t modify the data. However, if we were changing a reference-passed object, for example by changing data in a Task, we would have to make a deep copy first. This is because a PipeOp may never modify its input object by reference. Our train() and predict() functions are now: train = function(inputs) { self$state = list() c(inputs, inputs) }, predict = function(inputs) { c(inputs, inputs) } 7.2.1.4 Putting it Together The whole definition thus becomes PipeOpCopyTwo = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpCopyTwo&quot;, inherit = PipeOp, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;copy.two&quot;) { super$initialize(id, input = data.table::data.table(name = &quot;input&quot;, train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot;), output = data.table::data.table(name = c(&quot;output1&quot;, &quot;output2&quot;), train = &quot;*&quot;, predict = &quot;*&quot;) ) }, train = function(inputs) { self$state = list() c(inputs, inputs) }, predict = function(inputs) { c(inputs, inputs) } ) ) We can create an instance of our PipeOp, put it in a graph, and see what happens when we train it on something: poct = PipeOpCopyTwo$new() gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(poct) print(gr) #&gt; Graph with 1 PipeOps: #&gt; ID State sccssors prdcssors #&gt; copy.two &lt;&lt;UNTRAINED&gt;&gt; result = gr$train(task) str(result) #&gt; List of 2 #&gt; $ copy.two.output1:Classes &#39;TaskClassif&#39;, &#39;TaskSupervised&#39;, &#39;Task&#39;, &#39;R6&#39; &lt;TaskClassif:iris&gt; #&gt; $ copy.two.output2:Classes &#39;TaskClassif&#39;, &#39;TaskSupervised&#39;, &#39;Task&#39;, &#39;R6&#39; &lt;TaskClassif:iris&gt; 7.2.2 Special Case: Preprocessing Many PipeOps perform an operation on exactly one Task, and return exactly one Task. They may even not care about the “Target” / “Outcome” variable of that task, and only do some modification of some input data. However, it is usually important to them that the Task on which they perform prediction has the same data columns as the Task on which they train. For these cases, the auxiliary base class PipeOpTaskPreproc exists. It inherits from PipeOp itself, and other PipeOps should use it if they fall in the kind of use-case named above. When inheriting from PipeOpTaskPreproc, one must either implement the train_task and predict_task functions, or the train_dt, predict_dt functions, depending on whether wants to operate on a Task object or on data.tables. In the second case, one can optionally also overload the select_cols function, which chooses which of the incoming Task’s features are given to the train_dt / predict_dt functions. The following will show two examples: PipeOpDropNA, which removes a Task’s rows with missing values during training (and implements train_task and predict_task), and PipeOpScale, which scales a Task’s numeric columns (and implements train_dt, predict_dt, and select_cols). 7.2.2.1 Example: PipeOpDropNA Dropping rows with missing values may be important when training a model that can not handle them. Because mlr3 Tasks only contain a view to the underlying data, it is not necessary to modify data to remove rows with missing values. Instead, the rows can be removed using the Task’s $filter method, which modifies the Task in-place. This is done in the train_task function. We take care that we also set the $state slot to signal that the PipeOp was trained. The predict_task function does not need to do anything; removing missing values during prediction is not as useful, since learners that cannot handle them will just ignore the respective rows. Furthermore, mlr3 expects a Learner to always return just as many predictions as it was given input rows, so a PipeOp that removes Task rows during training can not be used inside a GraphLearner. When we inherit from PipeOpTaskPreproc, it sets the input and output data.tables for us to only accept a single Task. The only thing we do during initialize() is therefore to set an id (which can optionally be changed by the user). The complete PipeOpDropNA can therefore be written as follows. Note that it inherits from PipeOpTaskPreproc, unlike the PipeOpCopyTwo example from above: PipeOpDropNA = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpDropNA&quot;, inherit = PipeOpTaskPreproc, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;drop.na&quot;) { super$initialize(id) }, train_task = function(task) { self$state = list() featuredata = task$data(cols = task$feature_names) exclude = apply(is.na(featuredata), 1, any) task$filter(task$row_ids[!exclude]) }, predict_task = function(task) { # nothing to be done task } ) ) To test this PipeOp, we create a small task with missing values: smalliris = iris[(1:5) * 30, ] smalliris[1, 1] = NA smalliris[2, 2] = NA sitask = TaskClassif$new(&quot;smalliris&quot;, as_data_backend(smalliris), &quot;Species&quot;) print(sitask$data()) #&gt; Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa 1.6 0.2 NA 3.2 #&gt; 2: versicolor 3.9 1.4 5.2 NA #&gt; 3: versicolor 4.0 1.3 5.5 2.5 #&gt; 4: virginica 5.0 1.5 6.0 2.2 #&gt; 5: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 We test this by feeding it to a new Graph that uses PipeOpDropNA. gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(PipeOpDropNA$new()) filtered_task = gr$train(sitask)[[1]] print(filtered_task$data()) #&gt; Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: versicolor 4.0 1.3 5.5 2.5 #&gt; 2: virginica 5.0 1.5 6.0 2.2 #&gt; 3: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 7.2.2.2 Example: PipeOpScaleAlways An often-applied preprocessing step is to simply center and/or scale the data to mean \\(0\\) and standard deviation \\(1\\). This fits the PipeOpTaskPreproc pattern quite well. Because it always replaces all columns that it operates on, and does not require any information about the task’s target, it only needs to overload the train_dt and predict_dt functions. This saves some boilerplate-code from getting the correct feature columns out of the task, and replacing them after modification. Because scaling only makes sense on numeric features, we want to instruct PipeOpTaskPreproc to give us only these numeric columns. We do this by overloading the select_cols function: It is called by the class to determine which columns to give to train_dt and predict_dt. Its input is the Task that is being transformed, and it should return a character vector of all features to work with. When it is not overloaded, it uses all columns; instead, we will set it to only give us numeric columns. Because the levels() of the data table given to train_dt and predict_dt may be different from the levels task’s levels, these functions must also take a levels argument that is a named list of column names indicating their levels. When working with numeric data, this argument can be ignored, but it should be used instead of levels(dt[[column]]) for factorial or character columns. This is the first PipeOp where we will be using the $state slot for something useful: We save the centering offset and scaling coefficient and use it in $predict()! For simplicity, we are not using hyperparameters and will always scale and center all data. Compare this PipeOpScaleAlways operator to the one defined inside the mlr3pipelines package, PipeOpScale, defined in PipeOpScale.R. PipeOpScaleAlways = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpScaleAlways&quot;, inherit = PipeOpTaskPreproc, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;scale.always&quot;) { super$initialize(id = id) }, select_cols = function(task) { task$feature_types[type == &quot;numeric&quot;, id] }, train_dt = function(dt, levels) { sc = scale(as.matrix(dt)) self$state = list( center = attr(sc, &quot;scaled:center&quot;), scale = attr(sc, &quot;scaled:scale&quot;) ) sc }, predict_dt = function(dt, levels) { t((t(dt) - self$state$center) / self$state$scale) } ) ) (Note for the observant: If you check PipeOpScale.R from the mlr3pipelines package, you will notice that is uses “get(&quot;type&quot;)” and “get(&quot;id&quot;)” instead of “type” and “id”, because the static code checker on CRAN would otherwise complain about references to undefined variables. This is a “problem” with data.table and not exclusive to mlr3pipelines.) We can, again, create a new Graph that uses this PipeOp to test it. Compare the resulting data to the original “iris” Task data printed at the beginning: gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(PipeOpScaleAlways$new()) result = gr$train(task) result[[1]]$data() #&gt; Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -0.89767 1.01560 #&gt; 2: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.13920 -0.13154 #&gt; 3: setosa -1.3924 -1.3111 -1.38073 0.32732 #&gt; 4: setosa -1.2791 -1.3111 -1.50149 0.09789 #&gt; 5: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.01844 1.24503 #&gt; --- #&gt; 146: virginica 0.8169 1.4440 1.03454 -0.13154 #&gt; 147: virginica 0.7036 0.9192 0.55149 -1.27868 #&gt; 148: virginica 0.8169 1.0504 0.79301 -0.13154 #&gt; 149: virginica 0.9302 1.4440 0.43072 0.78617 #&gt; 150: virginica 0.7602 0.7880 0.06843 -0.13154 7.2.3 Special Case: Preprocessing with Simple Train It is possible to make even further simplifications for many PipeOps that perform mostly the same operation during training and prediction. The point of Task preprocessing is often to modify the training data in mostly the same way as prediction data (but in a way that may depend on training data). Consider constant feature removal, for example: The goal is to remove features that have no variance, or only a single factor level. However, what features get removed must be decided during training, and may only depend on training data. Furthermore, the actual process of removing features is the same during training and prediction. A simplification to make is therefore to have a function get_state(task) which sets the $state slot during training, and a transform(task) function, which gets called both during training and prediction. This is done in the PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple class. Just like PipeOpTaskPreproc, one can inherit from this and overload these functions to get a PipeOp that performs preprocessing with very little boilerplate code. Just like PipeOpTaskPreproc, PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple offers the possibility to instead overload the get_state_dt(dt, levels) and transform_dt(dt, levels) functions (and optionally, again, the select_cols(task) function) to operate on data.table feature data instead of the whole Task. Even some methods that do not use PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple could work in a similar way: The PipeOpScaleAlways example from above will be shown to also work with this paradigm. 7.2.3.1 Example: PipeOpDropConst A typical example of a preprocessing operation that does almost the same operation during training and prediction is an operation that drops features depending on a criterion that is evaluated during training. One simple example of this is dropping constant features. Because the mlr3 Task class offers a flexible view on underlying data, it is most efficient to drop columns from the task directly using its $select() function, so the get_state_dt(dt, levels) / transform_dt(dt, levels) functions will not get used; instead we overload the get_state(task) and transform(task) functions. The get_state() function’s result is saved to the $state slot, so we want to return something that is useful for dropping features. We choose to save the names of all the columns that have nonzero variance. For brevity, we use length(unique(column)) &gt; 1 to check whether more than one distinct value is present; a more sophisticated version could have a tolerance parameter for numeric values that are very close to each other. The transform() function is evaluated both during training and prediction, and can rely on the $state slot being present. All it does here is call the Task$select function with the columns we chose to keep. The full PipeOp could be written as follows: PipeOpDropConst = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpDropConst&quot;, inherit = PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;drop.const&quot;) { super$initialize(id = id) }, get_state = function(task) { data = task$data(cols = task$feature_names) nonconst = sapply(data, function(column) length(unique(column)) &gt; 1) list(cnames = colnames(data)[nonconst]) }, transform = function(task) { task$select(self$state$cnames) } ) ) This can be tested using the first five rows of the “Iris” Task, for which one feature (&quot;Petal.Width&quot;) is constant: irishead = task$clone()$filter(1:5) irishead$data() #&gt; Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 #&gt; 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 #&gt; 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 #&gt; 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 #&gt; 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 gr = Graph$new()$add_pipeop(PipeOpDropConst$new()) dropped_task = gr$train(irishead)[[1]] dropped_task$data() #&gt; Species Petal.Length Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa 1.4 5.1 3.5 #&gt; 2: setosa 1.4 4.9 3.0 #&gt; 3: setosa 1.3 4.7 3.2 #&gt; 4: setosa 1.5 4.6 3.1 #&gt; 5: setosa 1.4 5.0 3.6 We can also see that the $state was correctly set. Calling $predict() with this graph, even with different data (the whole Iris Task!) will still drop the &quot;Petal.Width&quot; column, as it should. gr$pipeops$drop.const$state #&gt; $cnames #&gt; [1] &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $affected_cols #&gt; [1] &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $intasklayout #&gt; id type #&gt; 1: Petal.Length numeric #&gt; 2: Petal.Width numeric #&gt; 3: Sepal.Length numeric #&gt; 4: Sepal.Width numeric #&gt; #&gt; $outtasklayout #&gt; id type #&gt; 1: Petal.Length numeric #&gt; 2: Sepal.Length numeric #&gt; 3: Sepal.Width numeric dropped_predict = gr$predict(task)[[1]] dropped_predict$data() #&gt; Species Petal.Length Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa 1.4 5.1 3.5 #&gt; 2: setosa 1.4 4.9 3.0 #&gt; 3: setosa 1.3 4.7 3.2 #&gt; 4: setosa 1.5 4.6 3.1 #&gt; 5: setosa 1.4 5.0 3.6 #&gt; --- #&gt; 146: virginica 5.2 6.7 3.0 #&gt; 147: virginica 5.0 6.3 2.5 #&gt; 148: virginica 5.2 6.5 3.0 #&gt; 149: virginica 5.4 6.2 3.4 #&gt; 150: virginica 5.1 5.9 3.0 7.2.3.2 Example: PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple This example will show how a PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple can be used when only working on feature data in form of a data.table. Instead of calling the scale() function, the center and scale values are calculated directly and saved to the $state slot. The transform_dt function will then perform the same operation during both training and prediction: subtract the center and divide by the scale value. As in the PipeOpScaleAlways example above, we use select_cols() so that we only work on numeric columns. PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple = R6::R6Class(&quot;PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple&quot;, inherit = PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple, public = list( initialize = function(id = &quot;scale.always.simple&quot;) { super$initialize(id = id) }, select_cols = function(task) { task$feature_types[type == &quot;numeric&quot;, id] }, get_state_dt = function(dt, levels) { list( center = sapply(dt, mean), scale = sapply(dt, sd) ) }, transform_dt = function(dt, levels) { t((t(dt) - self$state$center) / self$state$scale) } ) ) We can compare this PipeOp to the one above to show that it behaves the same. gr = Graph$new()$add_pipeop(PipeOpScaleAlways$new()) result_posa = gr$train(task)[[1]] gr = Graph$new()$add_pipeop(PipeOpScaleAlwaysSimple$new()) result_posa_simple = gr$train(task)[[1]] result_posa$data() #&gt; Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -0.89767 1.01560 #&gt; 2: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.13920 -0.13154 #&gt; 3: setosa -1.3924 -1.3111 -1.38073 0.32732 #&gt; 4: setosa -1.2791 -1.3111 -1.50149 0.09789 #&gt; 5: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.01844 1.24503 #&gt; --- #&gt; 146: virginica 0.8169 1.4440 1.03454 -0.13154 #&gt; 147: virginica 0.7036 0.9192 0.55149 -1.27868 #&gt; 148: virginica 0.8169 1.0504 0.79301 -0.13154 #&gt; 149: virginica 0.9302 1.4440 0.43072 0.78617 #&gt; 150: virginica 0.7602 0.7880 0.06843 -0.13154 result_posa_simple$data() #&gt; Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -0.89767 1.01560 #&gt; 2: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.13920 -0.13154 #&gt; 3: setosa -1.3924 -1.3111 -1.38073 0.32732 #&gt; 4: setosa -1.2791 -1.3111 -1.50149 0.09789 #&gt; 5: setosa -1.3358 -1.3111 -1.01844 1.24503 #&gt; --- #&gt; 146: virginica 0.8169 1.4440 1.03454 -0.13154 #&gt; 147: virginica 0.7036 0.9192 0.55149 -1.27868 #&gt; 148: virginica 0.8169 1.0504 0.79301 -0.13154 #&gt; 149: virginica 0.9302 1.4440 0.43072 0.78617 #&gt; 150: virginica 0.7602 0.7880 0.06843 -0.13154 7.2.4 Hyperparameters mlr3pipelines uses the paradox package to define parameter spaces for PipeOps. Parameters for PipeOps can modify their behavior in certain ways, e.g. switch centering or scaling off in the PipeOpScale operator. The unified interface makes it possible to have parameters for whole Graphs that modify the individual PipeOp’s behavior. The Graphs, when encapsulated in GraphLearners, can even be tuned using the tuning functionality in mlr3tuning. Hyperparameters are declared during initialization, when calling the PipeOp’s $initialize() function, by giving a param_set argument. The param_set must be a ParamSet from the paradox package; see the mlr3book for more information on how to define parameter spaces. After construction, the ParamSet can be accessed through the $param_set slot. While it is possible to modify this ParamSet, using e.g. the $add() and $add_dep() functions, after adding it to the PipeOp, it is strongly advised against. Hyperparameters can be set and queried through the $values slot. When setting hyperparameters, they are automatically checked to satisfy all conditions set by the $param_set, so it is not necessary to type check them. Be aware that it is always possible to remove hyperparameter values. When a PipeOp is initialized, it usually does not have any parameter values—$values takes the value list(). It is possible to set initial parameter values in the $initialize() constructor; this must be done after the super$initialize() call where the corresponding ParamSet must be supplied. This is because setting $values checks against the current $param_set, which would fail if the $param_set was not set yet. When using an underlying library function (the scale function in PipeOpScale, say), then there is usually a “default” behaviour of that function when a parameter is not given. It is good practice to use this default behaviour whenever a parameter is not set (or when it was removed). This can easily be done when using the mlr3misc library’s invoke() function, which has functionality similar to base::do.call(). 7.2.4.1 Hyperparameter Example: PipeOpScale How to use hyperparameters can best be shown through the example of PipeOpScale, which is very similar to the example above, PipeOpScaleAlways. The difference is made by the presence of hyperparameters. PipeOpScale constructs a ParamSet in its $initialize function and passes this on to the super$initialize function: PipeOpScale$public_methods$initialize #&gt; function (id = &quot;scale&quot;, param_vals = list()) #&gt; { #&gt; ps = ParamSet$new(params = list(ParamLgl$new(&quot;center&quot;, default = TRUE), #&gt; ParamLgl$new(&quot;scale&quot;, default = TRUE))) #&gt; super$initialize(id = id, param_set = ps, param_vals = param_vals) #&gt; } #&gt; &lt;bytecode: 0x172fd590&gt; #&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:mlr3pipelines&gt; The user has access to this and can set and get parameters. Types are automatically checked: pss = PipeOpScale$new() print(pss$param_set) #&gt; ParamSet: scale #&gt; id class lower upper levels default value #&gt; 1: center ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE TRUE #&gt; 2: scale ParamLgl NA NA TRUE,FALSE TRUE #&gt; 3: affect_columns ParamUty NA NA &lt;NoDefault&gt; pss$values$center = FALSE print(pss$values) #&gt; $center #&gt; [1] FALSE pss$values$scale = &quot;TRUE&quot; # bad input is checked! #&gt; Error in (function (xs) : Assertion on &#39;xs&#39; failed: scale: Must be of type &#39;logical flag&#39;, not &#39;character&#39;. How PipeOpScale handles its parameters can be seen in its $train method: It gets the relevant parameters from its $values slot and uses them in the mlr3misc::invoke call. This has the advantage over calling scale() directly that if a parameter is not given, its default value from the base::scale function will be used. PipeOpScale$public_methods$train #&gt; function (dt, levels) #&gt; { #&gt; sc = invoke(scale, as.matrix(dt), .args = self$param_set$values) #&gt; self$state = list(center = attr(sc, &quot;scaled:center&quot;) %??% #&gt; 0, scale = attr(sc, &quot;scaled:scale&quot;) %??% 1) #&gt; constfeat = self$state$scale == 0 #&gt; self$state$scale[constfeat] = 1 #&gt; sc[, constfeat] = 0 #&gt; sc #&gt; } #&gt; &lt;bytecode: 0x173091a8&gt; #&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:mlr3pipelines&gt; Another change that is necessary compared to PipeOpScaleAlways is that the attributes &quot;scaled:scale&quot; and &quot;scaled:center&quot; are not always present, depending on parameters, and possibly need to be set to default values \\(1\\) or \\(0\\), respectively. It is now even possible (if a bit pointless) to call PipeOpScale with both scale and center set to FALSE, which returns the original dataset, unchanged. pss$values$scale = FALSE pss$values$center = FALSE gr = Graph$new() gr$add_pipeop(pss) result = gr$train(task) result[[1]]$data() #&gt; Species Petal.Length Petal.Width Sepal.Length Sepal.Width #&gt; 1: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.1 3.5 #&gt; 2: setosa 1.4 0.2 4.9 3.0 #&gt; 3: setosa 1.3 0.2 4.7 3.2 #&gt; 4: setosa 1.5 0.2 4.6 3.1 #&gt; 5: setosa 1.4 0.2 5.0 3.6 #&gt; --- #&gt; 146: virginica 5.2 2.3 6.7 3.0 #&gt; 147: virginica 5.0 1.9 6.3 2.5 #&gt; 148: virginica 5.2 2.0 6.5 3.0 #&gt; 149: virginica 5.4 2.3 6.2 3.4 #&gt; 150: virginica 5.1 1.8 5.9 3.0 "],

A correct decision means that the bank predicts that a customer will pay their bills (hence would obtain a loan), and the customer indeed has good credit. On the other hand, a wrong decision means that the bank predicts that the customer’s credit is in good standing, but the opposite is true. This would result in a loss of 100% of the given loan. Good Customer (truth) Bad Customer (truth) Good Customer (predicted) + 0.35 - 1.0 Bad Customer (predicted) 0 0 Expressed as costs (instead of profit), we can write down the cost-matrix as follows: costs = matrix(c(-0.35, 0, 1, 0), nrow = 2) dimnames(costs) = list(response = c(&quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;), truth = c(&quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;)) print(costs) #&gt; truth #&gt; response good bad #&gt; good -0.35 1 #&gt; bad 0.00 0 An exemplary data set for such a problem is the German Credit task: library(mlr3) task = mlr_tasks$get(&quot;german_credit&quot;) table(task$truth()) #&gt; #&gt; good bad #&gt; 700 300 The data has 70% customers who are able to pay back their credit, and 30% bad customers who default on the debt. A manager, who doesn’t have any model, could decide to give either everybody a credit or to give nobody a credit. The resulting costs for the German credit data are: # nobody: (700 * costs[2, 1] + 300 * costs[2, 2]) / 1000 #&gt; [1] 0 # everybody (700 * costs[1, 1] + 300 * costs[1, 2]) / 1000 #&gt; [1] 0.055 If the average loan is $20,000, the credit institute would lose more than one million dollar if it would grant everybody a credit: # average profit * average loan * number of customers 0.055 * 20000 * 1000 #&gt; [1] 1100000 Our goal is to find a model which minimizes the costs (and thereby maximizes the expected profit). 8.6.1 A First Model For our first model, we choose an ordinary logistic regression (implemented in the add-on package mlr3learners). We first create a classification task, then resample the model using a 10-fold cross validation and extract the resulting confusion matrix: library(mlr3learners) learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.log_reg&quot;) rr = resample(task, learner, &quot;cv&quot;) confusion = rr$prediction$confusion print(confusion) #&gt; truth #&gt; response good bad #&gt; good 614 153 #&gt; bad 86 147 To calculate the average costs like above, we can simply multiply the elements of the confusion matrix with the elements of the previously introduced cost matrix, and sum the values of the resulting matrix: avg_costs = sum(confusion * costs) / 1000 print(avg_costs) #&gt; [1] -0.0619 With an average loan of $20,000, the logistic regression yields the following costs: avg_costs * 20000 * 1000 #&gt; [1] -1238000 Instead of losing over $1,000,000, the credit institute now can expect a profit of more than $1,000,000. 8.6.2 Cost-sensitive Measure Our natural next step would be to further improve the modeling step in order to maximize the profit. For this purpose we first create a cost-sensitive classification measure which calculates the costs based on our cost matrix. This allows us to conveniently quantify and compare modeling decisions. Fortunately, there already is a predefined measure Measure for this purpose: MeasureClassifCosts: cost_measure = MeasureClassifCosts$new(&quot;credit_costs&quot;, costs) print(cost_measure) #&gt; &lt;MeasureClassifCosts:credit_costs&gt; #&gt; * Packages: - #&gt; * Range: [-Inf, Inf] #&gt; * Minimize: TRUE #&gt; * Properties: requires_task #&gt; * Predict type: response If we now call resample() or benchmark(), the cost-sensitive measures will be evaluated. We compare the logistic regression to a simple featureless learner and to a random forest from package ranger : learners = mlr_learners$mget(c(&quot;classif.log_reg&quot;, &quot;classif.featureless&quot;, &quot;classif.ranger&quot;)) bmr = benchmark(expand_grid(task, learners, &quot;cv&quot;)) bmr$aggregate(cost_measure) #&gt; hash resample_result task_id learner_id #&gt; 1: 80982716484a73f6 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; german_credit classif.log_reg #&gt; 2: f015510c1e47fb34 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; german_credit classif.featureless #&gt; 3: f7b987af037742d0 &lt;ResampleResult&gt; german_credit classif.ranger #&gt; resampling_id credit_costs #&gt; 1: cv -0.05445 #&gt; 2: cv 0.05500 #&gt; 3: cv -0.05265 As expected, the featureless learner is performing comparably bad. The logistic regression and the random forest work equally well. 8.6.3 Thresholding Although we now correctly evaluate the models in a cost-sensitive fashion, the models themselves are unaware of the classification costs. They assume the same costs for both wrong classification decisions (false positives and false negatives). Some learners natively support cost-sensitive classification (e.g., XXX). However, we will concentrate on a more generic approach which works for all models which can predict probabilities for class labels: thresholding. Most learners can calculate the probability \\(p\\) for the positive class. If \\(p\\) exceeds the threshold \\(0.5\\), they predict the positive class, and the negative class otherwise. For our binary classification case of the credit data, the we primarily want to minimize the errors where the model predicts “good”, but truth is “bad” (i.e., the number of false positives) as this is the more expensive error. If we now increase the threshold to values \\(&gt; 0.5\\), we reduce the number of false negatives. Note that we increase the number of false positives simultaneously, or, in other words, we are trading false positives for false negatives. # fit models with probability prediction learner = mlr_learners$get(&quot;classif.log_reg&quot;, predict_type = &quot;prob&quot;) rr = resample(task, learner, &quot;cv&quot;) p = rr$prediction print(p) #&gt; &lt;PredictionClassif&gt; for 1000 observations: #&gt; row_id truth response prob.good prob.bad #&gt; 1 good good 0.9791 0.02093 #&gt; 6 good good 0.7289 0.27115 #&gt; 8 good good 0.6565 0.34352 #&gt; --- #&gt; 953 bad good 0.6428 0.35719 #&gt; 972 good good 0.7422 0.25779 #&gt; 980 bad bad 0.3790 0.62103 # helper function to try different threshold values interactively with_threshold = function(p, th) { p$set_threshold(th) list(confusion = p$confusion, costs = p$score(measures = cost_measure, task = task)) } with_threshold(p, 0.5) #&gt; $confusion #&gt; truth #&gt; response good bad #&gt; good 607 154 #&gt; bad 93 146 #&gt; #&gt; $costs #&gt; credit_costs #&gt; -0.05845 with_threshold(p, 0.75) #&gt; $confusion #&gt; truth #&gt; response good bad #&gt; good 467 72 #&gt; bad 233 228 #&gt; #&gt; $costs #&gt; credit_costs #&gt; -0.09145 with_threshold(p, 1.0) #&gt; $confusion #&gt; truth #&gt; response good bad #&gt; good 0 1 #&gt; bad 700 299 #&gt; #&gt; $costs #&gt; credit_costs #&gt; 0.001 # TODO: include plot of threshold vs performance Instead of manually trying different threshold values, we here use optimize() to find a good threshold value w.r.t. our performance measure: # simple wrapper function which takes a threshold and returns the resulting model performance # this wrapper is passed to optimize() to find its minimum for thresholds in [0.5, 1] f = function(th) { with_threshold(p, th)$costs } best = optimize(f, c(0.5, 1)) print(best) #&gt; $minimum #&gt; [1] 0.7694 #&gt; #&gt; $objective #&gt; credit_costs #&gt; -0.0929 # optimized confusion matrix: with_threshold(p, best$minimum)$confusion #&gt; truth #&gt; response good bad #&gt; good 454 66 #&gt; bad 246 234 The function optimize() is intended for unimodal functions and therefore may converge to a local optimum here.

This helps us to get a first impression of our data and might help us arrive at additional features that can help with the prediction of the house prices.

The variable we want to predict is price. In addition to the price column, we have several other columns: id: A unique identifier for every house. date: A date column, indicating when the house was sold. This column is currently not encoded as a date and requires some preprocessing. zipcode: A column indicating the ZIP code. This is a categorical variable with many factor levels. long, lat The longitude and latitude of the house ... several other numeric columns providing information about the house, such as number of rooms, square feet etc. Before we continue with the analysis, we preprocess some features so that they are stored in the correct format. First we convert the date column to numeric to be able to treat it as a numeric feature: library(lubridate) house_sales_prediction$date = ymd(substr(house_sales_prediction$date, 1, 8)) house_sales_prediction$date = as.numeric(as.Date(house_sales_prediction$date, origin = &quot;1900-01-01&quot;)) house_sales_prediction$date = house_sales_prediction$date Afterwards, we convert the zipcode to a factor: house_sales_prediction$zipcode = as.factor(house_sales_prediction$zipcode) And add a new column renovated indicating whether a house was renovated at some point. house_sales_prediction$renovated = as.numeric(house_sales_prediction$yr_renovated &gt; 0) # And drop the id column: house_sales_prediction$id = NULL Additionally we convert the price from Dollar to units of 1000 Dollar to improve readability. house_sales_prediction$price = house_sales_prediction$price / 1000 We can now plot the density of the price to get a first impression on its distribution. library(ggplot2) ggplot(house_sales_prediction, aes(x = price)) + geom_density() We can see that the prices for most houses lie between 75.000 and 1.5 million dollars. There are few extreme values of up to 7.7 million dollars. Feature engineering often allows us to incorporate additional knowledge about the data and underlying processes. This can often greatly enhance predictive performance. A simple example: A house which has yr_renovated == 0 means that is has not been renovated yet. Additionally we want to drop features which should not have any influence (id column). After those initial manipulations, we load all required packages and create a Task containing our data. library(mlr3) library(mlr3viz) tsk = TaskRegr$new(&quot;sales&quot;, house_sales_prediction, target = &quot;price&quot;) We can inspect associations between variables using mlr3viz’s autoplot function in order to get some good first impressions for our data. Note, that this does in no way prevent us from using other powerful plot functions of our choice on the original data. 10.1.1.1 Distribution of the price: The outcome we want to predict is the price variable. The autoplot function provides a good first glimpse on our data. As the resulting object is a ggplot2 object, we can use faceting and other functions from ggplot2 in order to enhance plots. library(ggplot2) autoplot(tsk) + facet_wrap(~renovated) We can observe that renovated flats seem to achieve higher sales values, and this might thus be a relevant feature. Additionally, we can for example look at the condition of the house. Again, we clearly can see that the price rises with increasing condition. autoplot(tsk) + facet_wrap(~condition) 10.1.1.2 Association between variables In addition to the association with the target variable, the association between the features can also lead to interesting insights. We investigate using variables associated with the quality and size of the house. Note that we use $clone() and $select() to clone the task and select only a subset of the features for the autoplot function, as autoplot per default uses all features. The task is cloned before we select features in order to keep the original task intact. # Variables associated with quality autoplot(tsk$clone()$select(tsk$feature_names[c(3, 17)]), type = &quot;pairs&quot;) autoplot(tsk$clone()$select(tsk$feature_names[c(9:12)]), type = &quot;pairs&quot;) 10.1.2 Splitting into train and test data In mlr3, we do not create train and test data sets, but instead keep only a vector of train and test indices. set.seed(4411) train.idx = sample(seq_len(tsk$nrow), 0.7 * tsk$nrow) test.idx = setdiff(seq_len(tsk$nrow), train.idx) 10.1.3 A first model: Decision Tree Decision tree’s cannot only be used as a powerful tool for predictive models but for exploratory data analysis. In order to fit a decision tree, we first get the regr.rpart learner from the mlr_learners dictionary. For now we leave out the zipcode variable, as we also have the latitude and longitude of each house. tsk_nozip = tsk$clone()$select(setdiff(tsk$feature_names, &quot;zipcode&quot;)) # Get the learner lrn = mlr_learners$get(&quot;regr.rpart&quot;) # And train on the task lrn$train(tsk_nozip, row_ids = train.idx) plot(lrn$model) text(lrn$model) The learned tree relies on several variables in order to distinguish between cheaper and pricier houses. The features we split along are grade, sqft_living, but also some features related to the area (longitude and latitude). We can visualize the price across different regions in order to get more info: # Load the ggmap package in order to visualize on a map library(ggmap) # And create a quick plot for the price qmplot(long, lat, maptype = &quot;watercolor&quot;, color = log(price), data = house_sales_prediction[train.idx[1:3000],]) + scale_colour_viridis_c() # And the zipcode qmplot(long, lat, maptype = &quot;watercolor&quot;, color = zipcode, data = house_sales_prediction[train.idx[1:3000],]) + guides(color = FALSE) We can see that the price is clearly associated with the zipcode when comparing the two plots. As a result, we might want to indeed use the zipcode column in our future endeavours. 10.1.4 A first baseline: Decision Tree After getting an initial idea for our data, we might want to construct a first baseline, in order to see what a simple model already can achieve. We use resample with 3-fold cross-validation on our training data in order to get a reliable estimate of the algorithm’s performance on future data. Before we start with defining and training learners, we create a Resampling in order to make sure that we always compare on exactly the same data. library(mlr3learners) cv3 = mlr_resamplings$get(&quot;cv3&quot;) cv3$instantiate(tsk$clone()$filter(train.idx)) For the cross-validation we only use the training data by cloning the task and selecting only observations from the training set. lrn_rpart = mlr_learners$get(&quot;regr.rpart&quot;) res = resample(task = tsk$clone()$filter(train.idx), lrn_rpart, cv3) res$performance(&quot;regr.mse&quot;) #&gt; task task_id learner learner_id resampling #&gt; 1: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRpart&gt; regr.rpart &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 2: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRpart&gt; regr.rpart &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 3: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRpart&gt; regr.rpart &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; resampling_id iteration prediction regr.mse #&gt; 1: cv3 1 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 45416 #&gt; 2: cv3 2 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 49599 #&gt; 3: cv3 3 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 42518 sprintf(&quot;RMSE of the simple rpart: %s&quot;, round(sqrt(res$aggregate()), 2)) #&gt; [1] &quot;RMSE of the simple rpart: 214.11&quot; 10.1.5 Many Trees: Random Forest We might be able to improve upon the RMSE using more powerful learners. We first load the mlr3learners package, which contains the ranger learner (a package which implements the “Random Forest” algorithm). lrn_ranger = mlr_learners$get(&quot;regr.ranger&quot;, param_vals = list(num.trees = 15L)) res = resample(task = tsk$clone()$filter(train.idx), lrn_ranger, cv3) res$performance(&quot;regr.mse&quot;) #&gt; task task_id learner learner_id resampling #&gt; 1: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 2: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 3: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; resampling_id iteration prediction regr.mse #&gt; 1: cv3 1 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 23892 #&gt; 2: cv3 2 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 22455 #&gt; 3: cv3 3 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 18899 sprintf(&quot;RMSE of the simple ranger: %s&quot;, round(sqrt(res$aggregate()), 2)) #&gt; [1] &quot;RMSE of the simple ranger: 147.48&quot; Often tuning RandomForest methods does not increase predictive performances substantially. If time permits, it can nonetheless lead to improvements and should thus be performed. In this case, we resort to tune a different kind of model: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees from the package xgboost. 10.1.6 A better baseline: AutoTuner Tuning can often further improve the performance. In this case, we tune the xgboost learner in order to see whether this can improve performance. For the AutoTuner we have to specify a Termination Criterion (how long the tuning should run) a Tuner (which tuning method to use) and a ParamSet (which space we might want to search through). For now we do not use the zipcode column, as xgboost cannot naturally deal with categorical features. The AutoTuner automatically performs nested cross-validation. set.seed(444L) library(mlr3tuning) library(paradox) lrn_xgb = mlr_learners$get(&quot;regr.xgboost&quot;) # Define the ParamSet ps = ParamSet$new( params = list( ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;eta&quot;, lower = 0.2, upper = .4), ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;min_child_weight&quot;, lower = 1, upper = 20), ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;subsample&quot;, lower = .7, upper = .8), ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;colsample_bytree&quot;, lower = .9, upper = 1), ParamDbl$new(id = &quot;colsample_bylevel&quot;, lower = .5, upper = .7), ParamInt$new(id = &quot;nrounds&quot;, lower = 1L, upper = 25) )) # Define the Terminator terminator = TerminatorEvaluations$new(10) at = AutoTuner$new(lrn_xgb, &quot;cv3&quot;, measures = &quot;regr.mse&quot;, ps, terminator, tuner = TunerRandomSearch, tuner_settings = list()) res$performance(&quot;regr.mse&quot;) sprintf(&quot;RMSE of the tuned xgboost: %s&quot;, round(sqrt(res$aggregate()), 2)) We can obtain the resulting params in the respective splits by accessing the ResampleResult. sapply(res$learners, function(x) x$param_set$values) #&gt; $num.trees #&gt; [1] 15 #&gt; #&gt; $num.trees #&gt; [1] 15 #&gt; #&gt; $num.trees #&gt; [1] 15 NOTE: To keep runtime low, we only tune parts of the hyperparameter space of xgboost in this example. Additionally, we only allow for \\(10\\) random search iterations, which is usually to little for real-world applications. Nonetheless, we are able to obtain an improved performance when comparing to the ranger model. In order to further improve our results we have several options: Find or engineer better features Remove Features to avoid overfitting Obtain additional data (often prohibitive) Try more models Improve the tuning Increase the tuning budget Enlarge the tuning search space Use a more efficient tuning algorithm Stacking and Ensembling (see Pipelines) Below we will investigate some of those possibilities and investigate whether this improves performance. 10.1.7 Engineering Features: Mutating ZIP-Codes In order to better cluster the zip codes, we compute a new feature: med_price: It computes the median price in each zip-code. This might help our model to improve the prediction. # Create a new feature and append it to the task zip_price = house_sales_prediction[, .(med_price = median(price)), by = zipcode] # Join on the original data to match with original columns, then cbind to the task tsk$cbind(house_sales_prediction[zip_price, on=&quot;zipcode&quot;][,&quot;med_price&quot;]) Again, we run resample and compute the RMSE. lrn_ranger = mlr_learners$get(&quot;regr.ranger&quot;) res = resample(task = tsk$clone()$filter(train.idx), lrn_ranger, cv3) res$performance(&quot;regr.mse&quot;) #&gt; task task_id learner learner_id resampling #&gt; 1: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 2: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 3: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; resampling_id iteration prediction regr.mse #&gt; 1: cv3 1 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 22719 #&gt; 2: cv3 2 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 20384 #&gt; 3: cv3 3 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 17799 sprintf(&quot;RMSE of ranger with med_price: %s&quot;, round(sqrt(res$aggregate()), 2)) #&gt; [1] &quot;RMSE of ranger with med_price: 142.48&quot; 10.1.8 Obtaining a sparser model In many cases, we might want to have a sparse model. For this purpose we can use a mlr3featse::Filter implemented in mlr3filters. This can prevent our learner from overfitting make it easier for humans to interpret models as fewer variables influence the resulting prediction. library(mlr3filters) filter = FilterMRMR$new()$calculate(tsk) tsk_ftsel = tsk$clone()$select(head(names(filter$scores), 12)) The resulting RMSE is slightly higher, and at the same time we only use \\(12\\) features. lrn_ranger = mlr_learners$get(&quot;regr.ranger&quot;) res = resample(task = tsk_ftsel$clone()$filter(train.idx), lrn_ranger, cv3) res$performance(&quot;regr.mse&quot;) #&gt; task task_id learner learner_id resampling #&gt; 1: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 2: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; 3: &lt;TaskRegr&gt; sales &lt;LearnerRegrRanger&gt; regr.ranger &lt;ResamplingCV&gt; #&gt; resampling_id iteration prediction regr.mse #&gt; 1: cv3 1 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 34720 #&gt; 2: cv3 2 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 29056 #&gt; 3: cv3 3 &lt;PredictionRegr&gt; 25907 sprintf(&quot;RMSE of ranger with filtering: %s&quot;, round(sqrt(res$aggregate()), 2)) #&gt; [1] &quot;RMSE of ranger with filtering: 172.9&quot; "],
